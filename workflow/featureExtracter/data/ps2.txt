The use of a new indirect method to estimate ethnic-group fertility rates for subnational projections for England
Paul Norman, Philip Rees & Pia Wohland

To project the ethnic-group populations of local authorities in England to 2051, estimates of ethnic-specific fertility rates were needed. In the absence of ethnic information on birth records, we developed indirect estimation methods that use a combination of vital statistics, the census (both microdata and aggregate tables), and survey data (Labour Force Survey). We estimated age-specific and total fertility rates successively for five broad ethnic groups encompassed by all data-sets, and for eight ethnic groups encompassed by the 1991 and 2001 Censuses for England. We then used census data to disaggregate the estimates to the 16 ethnic groups required for the subnational projections and the Hadwiger function to estimate single-year-of-age estimates. We estimated the uncertainty around the fertility estimates and used a logistic model to project rates to 2021, after which we assumed rates would remain constant.

Introduction
The role of ethnicity in subnational population projections

In censuses and surveys, variables that can inform on ethnic background include the following: country of birth or family origin, country of citizenship or nationality, race, language, and religion. There is a need to incorporate such information in demographic work for two broad reasons. The first is that such data are needed for planning purposes. Data on age and sex for members of ethnic subgroups are needed by local governments and other agencies in order to produce population estimates and projections for subnational areas. Knowledge of ethnic-group numbers by age and locality can help in estimating demand for particular goods and services such as language support, design of housing, and food choices. If we can estimate recent trends and project future populations for ethnic groups, then debates about diversity and immigration levels can be better informed. The second reason is that establishing the heterogeneity of population subgroups improves the quality of aggregate data. If different groups of people have distinct age-sex structures and demographic propensities, which is the case for different ethnic groups, details of these differences will lead to improved information about the population.

Methods for projecting ethnic populations

A range of methods exist for projecting populations, the most common of which is the cohort-component method. In this method, age-specific fertility, mortality, and migration rates are applied to an area’s base population to project the population in the future. Rees outlines the cohort-component method used for the official UK-wide national projections and shows how it can be extended to ethnic groups. For subnational projections, there is a need for robust estimates of ethnic-group fertility, mortality, and migration rates for local areas. In the UK, statistics on ethnic groups have been available from national surveys since the late 1970s and from the 1991 and 2001 Censuses. However, for population projections, the inclusion of age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) by ethnic group poses a problem because ethnicity is not recorded when births are registered.

In a number of countries, population projections are made for the different ethnic/racial groups that comprise the national population. For example, the US Census Bureau makes projections by race and Statistics New Zealand differentiates between groups which are European or Other, Māori, Asian, or Pacific in origin. For Australia, projections include regional populations by Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) and non-Indigenous status underpinned by census and vital events data. The practices of different European countries are reviewed by Coleman. Ethnicity is defined by citizenship or country of birth, which means that the offspring of foreign-born individuals are usually treated as indigenous for projection purposes after one or two generations.

Classifications of ethnicity in the UK are based on self-reporting for census or social survey questionnaires. The categories used are a compromise between the need to keep the question simple and the requirements of pressure groups, academics, and government practitioners for the ethnic detail needed for research and the formulation of policy. In the UK Census, ethnic-group classifications are based on two concepts: race and country of origin. To date, most estimates and projections use aggregated groups, which do not reveal the different demographic dynamics that might exist within subgroups. The 2001 Census revealed these groups to have relatively young age structures and potential for population growth, and thus demonstrated the limitations of mixed-group analyses.

Fertility variation by ethnic group and geographical area

Evidence has emerged that, cross-sectionally by age or in completed family size, fertility rates vary between ethnic groups in the UK. Compared with a white (largely British) reference group, women in ethnic groups originating from South Asian countries tend to have relatively high fertility. Among the South Asians, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups have higher fertility than the Indian group, whose fertility rates are gradually converging on the national level. The Chinese group has relatively low fertility. A more varied picture has emerged for Black African and Black Caribbean women. Boyle has shown that the geography of fertility matters, and Boyle et al. and Tromans et al. have revealed cross-sectional and time-series patterns. Since there are distinct geographical distributions of ethnic groups, we expected to find that variations in fertility by ethnic group would vary spatially.

A model for projecting ethnic-group populations for subnational areas in England

This paper reports on a method of estimating ASFRs by ethnic group for use in a projection model for local areas in England. The model provides population counts by age (0-100 and over) and sex. The projections start in 2001 and extend to 2051 in annual steps using England’s 352 local authorities (2001 Census boundary definitions). For the fertility component, the projection uses ASFRs applied to the population of women of childbearing age to yield total fertility rates (TFRs). We describe the methods used to estimate fertility at LA level in England for the 16 ethnic groups used in the 2001 Census. The method has also been applied using the ASFRs of ethnic groups in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, but only at national level.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. First, we report on the data sources, and then how we estimated fertility rates by ethnic group and 5-year age groups at both national and LA level. We go on to report on how we estimated single-year-of-age fertility rates from the 5-year grouped information. Since children can have a mother and a father of different ethnicities, we describe a method for estimating the ethnicity of the newborn. We quantify plausibility ranges of our estimates before going on to use past trends in ethnic fertility to inform our assumptions about future levels, which are entered into our projections. Finally, we summarize and reflect on the method of producing the estimates of ethnic fertility for subnational areas in England and consider some possible enhancements for future work.
Rates (ASFRs) by ethnic group poses a problem because ethnicity is not recorded when births are registered (Dubuc 2009; Williamson and Norman 2011). In a number of countries, population projections are made for the different ethnic/racial groups that comprise the national population. The US Census Bureau (2008) makes projections by race and Statistics New Zealand (2008) differentiates between groups which are European or Other, Māori, Asian, or Pacific in origin. For Australia, Wilson (2009) projects regional populations by Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) and non-Indigenous status underpinned by census and vital events data. The practices of different European countries are reviewed by Coleman (2006). Ethnicity is defined by citizenship or country of birth, which means that the offspring of foreign-born individuals are usually treated as indigenous for projection purposes after one or two generations.

Classifications of ethnicity in the UK are based on self-reporting for census or social survey questionnaires (ONS 2003). The categories used are a compromise between the need to keep the question simple and the requirements of pressure groups, academics, and government practitioners for the ethnic detail needed for research and the formulation of policy. In the UK Census, ethnic-group classifications are based on two concepts: race and country of origin. To date, most estimates and projections (e.g., Rees and Butt 2004; Coleman and Scherbov 2005; Coleman 2006; Rees and Parsons 2006) use aggregated groups, which do not reveal the different demographic dynamics that might exist within subgroups. The 2001 Census revealed these groups to have relatively young age structures and potential for population growth, and thus demonstrated the limitations of mixed-group analyses.

Fertility variation by ethnic group and geographical area

Evidence has emerged that, cross-sectionally by age or in completed family size, fertility rates vary between ethnic groups in the UK (Thompson 1982; Coleman and Salt 1992; Rees and Phillips 1996; Simpson 1997; Sporton and White 2002; Robson and Berthoud 2006; Dubuc 2009; Coleman and Dubuc 2010; Dubuc and Haskey 2010). Compared with a white (largely British) reference group, women in ethnic groups originating from South Asian countries tend to have relatively high fertility. Among the South Asians, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups have higher fertility than the Indian group, whose fertility rates are gradually converging on the national level. The Chinese group has relatively low fertility. A more varied picture has emerged for Black African and Black Caribbean women. Boyle (2003) has shown that the geography of fertility matters, and Boyle et al. (2007) and Tromans et al. (2008) have revealed cross-sectional and time-series patterns. Since there are distinct geographical distributions of ethnic groups (Rees and Butt 2004; Finney and Simpson 2009), we expected to find that variations in fertility by ethnic group would vary spatially.

A model for projecting ethnic-group populations for subnational areas in England

This paper reports on a method of estimating ASFRs by ethnic group for use in a projection model for local areas in England. The model provides population counts by age (0 to 100 and over) and sex (Rees et al. 2011). The projections start in 2001 and extend to 2051 in annual steps using England’s 352 local authorities (2001 Census boundary definitions). For the fertility component, the projection uses ASFRs applied to the population of women of childbearing age to yield total fertility rates (TFRs). We describe the methods used to estimate fertility at LA level in England for the 16 ethnic groups used in the 2001 Census. The method has also been applied using the ASFRs of ethnic groups in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, but only at national level.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. First, we report on the data sources, and then how we estimated fertility rates by ethnic group and 5-year age groups at both national and LA level. We go on to report on how we estimated single-year-of-age fertility rates from the 5-year grouped information. Since children can have a mother and a father of different ethnicities, we describe a method for estimating the ethnicity of the newborn. We quantify plausibility ranges of our estimates before going on to use past trends in ethnic fertility to inform our assumptions about future levels, which are entered into our projections. Finally, we summarize and reflect on the method of producing the estimates of ethnic fertility for subnational areas in England and consider some possible enhancements for future work.

Paul Norman et al.
Estimating fertility by ethnic group for England involves using a combination of sources and methods to calculate fertility rates at the national level. Methods include ratio and apportionment methods, where relationships between indicators are used to scale and distribute rates and counts, and constraints, where data from one source are controlled to sum to another, presumably more reliable, source.

The procedure begins with calculating Age-Specific Fertility Rates (ASFRs) and Total Fertility Rates (TFRs) for all women in a census year. The overall levels of fertility for eight ethnic groups were then estimated, using the Sample of Anonymised Records (SARs), followed by using information from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) to estimate differences in the age profile of fertility by ethnic group. A table from the 2001 Census was used to disaggregate the fertility rates by broad ethnic group into more selective ethnic groups. All estimates were controlled to ensure that the number of births across ethnic groups matched the national total of births by each 5-year age group.

For England specifically, ASFRs were calculated for 2001 using the counts of births by age of woman as numerators and the mid-year estimates as denominators. Births to women aged less than 20 and those aged over 40 were grouped together for rate calculations. The TFR calculated from these ASFRs was 1.63 children per woman.

Ethnic-specific fertility levels were estimated since birth registrations are not classified by ethnic group. Child-Woman Ratios (CWRs) were used to represent family size; these are defined by the ratio of children within a desired age range to women at risk over the fertile age groups. Using the SAR, a study population for England was created with recoded ethnic-group information. A national-level CWR linking women by ethnic group to the presence of a dependent child was computed, and this ratio was applied to the TFR for all women.

Data from the LFS was obtained for each year from the 1980s, harmonized to identify consistent ethnic groups over time. This information was used to calculate national age-specific rates by 5-year age group of woman and ethnic group for 2001. Combining this data with vital statistics, census, and survey estimates allowed for comprehensive estimates of ASFRs by the eight ethnic groups common to the 1991 and 2001 Censuses.

This combined approach ensures that the estimation process is thorough and incorporates multiple datasets to provide a reliable measure of fertility by ethnic group in England.
Combining the vital statistics, census, and survey fertility estimates for England, we combined the information from each separate source to make estimates of ASFRs by the eight ethnic groups common to the 1991 and 2001 Censuses. The method, described below, is shown as a set of six steps with their associated equations.

In Step 1, initial ASFRs are estimated by scaling the rates by age for each ethnic group by the vital-statistics-based all-women ASFRs and LFS-based all-women rates by age. The LFS-derived rates for the broader ethnic groups were applied to the ASFRs for more selective ethnic groups in equation (6). The rates for the combined Pakistani and Bangladeshi group were used for both of the separate groups. TFRs were calculated from these initial ASFRs by summation (equation (7)). 

In Step 2, the ASFRs from Step 1 were scaled to agree with the SAR-derived TFRs for each ethnic group in equation (8). In Step 3, the births by each ethnic group and age group of mother were calculated using equation (9).

In Step 4, the first estimates of births by ethnic group and age were scaled to sum to the vital statistics total for all women, using equation (10). In Step 5, the ASFRs by ethnic group were recalculated, using the births from Step 4, employing equation (11). In Step 6, Steps 2–5 were iterated until the fit of the data-sets no longer improved.

Disaggregating the age-specific fertility rates for England to the 16 ethnic groups of the 2001 Census, the White group and Other group common to the 1991 and 2001 Censuses required further disaggregation into three and seven more selective 2001 Census groups, respectively. A difficulty in relying on dataset is that the data may suffer from numerator and denominator bias if infants and mothers are missed in the census, fertility rates will be affected.

Estimates of total fertility rates by broad ethnic group based on the Sample of Anonymised Records, England 2001, show differences amongst groups. For instance, the TFR for the White group was 1.62, Black Caribbean 1.56, Black African 1.60, Indian 1.82, Pakistani 2.06, Bangladeshi 2.20, Chinese 1.26, and Other 1.48, indicating variations in fertility rates across different ethnic groups.

This adjusted method for breaking down national-level information in conjunction with local-area data allows more precise estimation of fertility rates by ethnic group across different regions.
Others and the broader White group to which they belonged and equivalently for the groups belonging to the Other category. This presumes that any census non-response is the same for the more selective groups as a subset of the larger group.

In Step 1, a TFR for the more selective group was calculated as the TFR for the broad group previously calculated, scaled by the ratio between the TFR for the more selective group and the broad group as evidenced by CO534. In Step 2, the ASFRs for the broad ethnic groups calculated previously were scaled by the ratio between the ASFRs for the more selective groups and the broad group as determined from CO534. TFRs were calculated as sums of the ASFR estimates. In Step 3, the ASFRs derived from Step 2 were scaled by the ratio between the TFRs for the more selective groups calculated in Step 1 and the TFRs derived from Step 2. In Step 4, the number of births for each ethnic group was calculated, using the mid-year estimate of women as the population at risk. In Step 5, the first estimate of births by ethnic group and age was scaled to sum to the total for the previous estimate of births for the broad group. In Step 6, the ASFRs for the more selective ethnic groups were recalculated using the births from Step 5. Finally, Steps 3-6 were iterated until the fit of the datasets no longer improved. The ASFRs for the groups which comprised the White and Other groups are illustrated in Figures 4(a) and (b).

The results of the estimations reported above are sets of 5-year ASFRs for eight ethnic groups for 1991 and 2001 and for 16 ethnic groups for England in 2001. Next, we describe how this national-level information was combined with LA-level data to estimate 5-year ASFRs by ethnic group for local areas.

Estimating fertility by ethnic group at the local level, the England-level fertility rates are combined with local-level information to estimate 5-year ASFRs for each LA in England. Since they have small populations, data for the City of London and the Isles of Scilly have been combined with the City of Westminster and Penwith, respectively. The procedure adopted for each LA was as follows: First, ASFRs and TFRs for all women in 2001 were calculated from vital statistics and mid-year populations. Next, overall levels of fertility by the eight ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 were estimated from local CWRs, adjusted using information from the SARs and the national-level ASFR estimates by the broad ethnic group to scale the local age profiles of fertility. Finally, for the 2001 rates, we re-allocated the information for the eight ethnic groups to the 16 groups used in the 2001 Census outputs. As they had been at the national level, these LA estimates of rates by ethnic group were controlled to make the number of births across ethnic groups sum to the local total of births by 5-year age groups. All the ASFRs were calculated for 5-year age groups. The subsequent estimation of single-year-of-age rates will be described later.

Fertility rates for local areas for all women were calculated using counts of births by age of the woman from the vital statistics as numerators and mid-year estimates as denominators. As with the national rates, births to women aged less than 20 were grouped together and divided by the total number of women aged 15-19. Births to women aged 40 and over were divided by the total number of women aged 40-44.
Overall levels of fertility by the eight ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 were estimated from local Child-Woman Ratios (CWRs), adjusted using information from the SARs and the national-level Age-Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR) estimates by broad ethnic group to scale the local age profiles of fertility. Finally, for the 2001 rates, we re-allocated the information for the eight ethnic groups to the 16 groups used in the 2001 Census outputs. As they had been at national level, these Local Authority (LA) estimates of rates by ethnic group were controlled to make the number of births across ethnic groups sum to the local total of births by 5-year age groups. All the ASFRs were calculated for 5-year age groups. The subsequent estimation of single-year-of-age rates will be described later.

Fertility rates for local areas for all women were calculated using ASFRs and Total Fertility Rates (TFRs) for all women using counts of births by age of woman from the vital statistics as numerators and mid-year estimates as denominators. As with the national rates, births to women aged less than 20 were grouped together and divided by the total number of women aged 15-19. Births to women aged 40 and over were divided by the total number of women aged 40-44. The ASFRs in 2001 for Bradford, West Yorkshire alongside the national curve show that this LA has a younger fertility profile than that shown for England as a whole and a TFR of 2.17. For 2001 in England, only Blackburn (2.19) and Newham (2.20) had higher TFRs than Bradford. The lowest TFRs were in the cities of Durham (1.14) and Cambridge (1.20).

Child-Woman Ratios (CWRs) can be used to proxy family size by ethnic group. We used total counts of children aged 0-4 and women aged 15-44 from the mid-year estimates by ethnic group in CWRs to indicate local variations in family size. For the eight ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 and for each LA in England, the TFR for all women in 2001 was scaled by each ethnic group's CWR divided by the CWR for all women.

A drawback of this procedure is that the fertility of the White group tends to be under-estimated and the fertility of non-White groups to be over-estimated. This discrepancy arises because if a child was reported at the 2001 Census as being of 'Mixed' ethnicity, this may have been because the mother was 'White' and the father 'Black'. However, when calculating the CWRs, the children of 'Other' ethnicity (into which the Mixed would be allocated) were linked only with Other group mothers, deflating the White CWR and inflating the Other CWR. Correction factors were needed to address this issue.

As noted previously, the individual-level data in the SARs give a realistic national-level CWR by directly linking women by ethnic group to the number of children they have had, and thus can be used to estimate ethnic-group-specific TFRs. The national CWR-based SARs and the area CWRs were used to provide ethnic-specific scaling factors through which the LA CWRs could be adjusted. The calculation proceeded as follows for each LA: TFRi e8 = TFRi + (CWRSAR e8 /CWR+ e8) * (CWRi e8/CWRi +)

The CWRs for the eight ethnic groups in each LA, scaled as above, were used to scale the TFR for all women to give an estimated TFR for each ethnic group. To avoid small-number exaggerations, where numbers of children or women fell below a threshold (100 persons), the CWR was calculated as the average of the national CWR for the ethnic group and the local all-women CWR.
Single year of age, by modelling age-specific fertility curves as mathematical functions (McNeil et al. 1977; Hoem et al. 1981; Chandola et al. 1999; Schmertmann 2003; Peristera and Kostaki 2007). These methods often include the fitting of splines and the application of the Hadwiger function (Hadwiger 1940), which was used for smoothing ASFRs in London boroughs (Hay and Hollis 2005). We used the Hadwiger function to compute robust estimates of fertility rates by single year of age. Details are given in Norman et al. (2011) and Williamson and Norman (2011). The ASFRs by single year of age and ethnic group for 2001 at both England level and LA level comprised the inputs to the projection model. All the rates described above are period-age fertility rates and these were converted to the period-cohort rates required in the projection model by averaging rates for successive years.

Estimating mixed ethnicity births and applying a sex ratio Since women may have partners of a different ethnicity from their own (Simpson 2002a; Sporton and White 2002), when the projection was run we included a step for generating the ethnicity of the newborn (Wilson 2009; Coleman 2010). We used Commissioned Table CO431 from the 2001 Census to estimate mixing probabilities, which cross-classify children under one in households by the ethnicity of their mother and the ethnicity assigned by their parent(s) on the census return.

In the projection model, after the ASFRs had been applied to the population at risk to estimate the births by ethnic group, a mixing matrix was applied to the births. The matrix contained the probabilities of the child’s ethnicity conditional on the mother’s ethnicity. Thus, transfers from one ethnic group to another could result. The main factors underpinning these transfers were partnerships between men and women of different ethnicities and decisions by parents about the ethnicity assigned to their offspring on the census form. Parents and children may also have had different ethnicities when children were adopted.

Estimating plausibility ranges for fertility rates and birth counts We have described the ASFRs and TFRs as estimates and should therefore reflect on their reliability. The aim was to use each data source for the advantage it had and to use triangulation and control to lessen the impact of potential error (Simpson 1998). Thus, it was essential that the counts of births, which resulted from the application of estimated ASFRs by ethnic group, returned the same counts of births by each 5-year age group at both England level and LA level as recorded in the vital registration system. The LFS sample was used to reveal differences in the shape of the fertility curve. It was necessary to compromise between pooling years of data to achieve a sample size large enough to estimate differences between a detailed set of ethnic groups (but losing possible variations across years) and pooling fewer years but only for broad ethnic groups. We pooled three years of LFS samples with child age centred on census year, but we did not differentiate between the estimated ASFRs for Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups or the Black African and Black Caribbean groups although in fact there are differences.

Extracting from the outputs of re-running the models, Table 12 shows equivalent data for Bradford, West Yorkshire as an example. The estimated TFRs are listed along with the plausibility range for the different TFRs which resulted from the concurrent application of 95 per cent lower and upper CIs derived from each of the different data sources at national level and of 95 per cent CIs for CWRs at LA level. As at national level, the estimated births in 2001 were constrained to sum to the vital registration totals by age, as had each version with the application of upper and lower CIs. The birth counts tabulated in the plausibility range are the minimum and maximum values which result for each ethnic group. There is variation in the TFRs for groups, but the extent to which this leads to different numbers of births depends on the size of the populations. For example, both the Black African and Chinese groups have quite wide variation in the TFRs shown (the LA CWRs have wide CIs because the populations are relatively small for these groups in Bradford) but the variation in the number of births is plus or minus less than one birth for each group. The plausibility range is therefore narrow.

Establishing assumptions about future age-specific fertility rates Essential to a population projection are plausible and justifiable assumptions about future levels of each demographic component. We used England-level annual time trends in fertility by age and ethnic group from 1991 to 2009 to inform assumptions about the direction of future fertility at LA level. Although the timeframe of the projection model runs to 2051, we restricted our predictions to the year 2021, using constant rates thereafter.

As inputs to establish past trends we used 5-year age-group information from the following sources: (i) an annual time series of ASFRs for England (updating Tromans et al. 2008); (ii) an annual time series of age-specific rates of the presence of a dependent child (LFS); and (iii) our estimates of ASFRs for 1991 and 2001 for the ethnic groups used for both these census years.

First, the 5-year ASFR estimates by ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 were scaled by growth (decline) rates in each age group as indicated by the change from one year to the next from 1991 to 2009 in the national all-women rates.

Second, the 5-year ASFR estimates by ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 were scaled by growth (decline) rates in each age group as indicated by the change from one year to the next in the rates for each broad ethnic group, using the LFS from 1991 to 2009.

Third, an annual time series of 5-year rates by ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 was obtained by averaging the results of equations.

Conclusions For policy-related and practical applications, there is a need for age-sex population counts and projections by ethnic group and subnational area. We have developed a new population projection model that generates details for 16 ethnic groups by age, sex, and LA areas in England. A model of this nature requires inputs of ethnic-specific demographic rates of fertility, mortality, and migration. We have given details of the estimation of ASFRs. The estimation of the other components are discussed elsewhere. Rees et al. provide a summary of the input estimations, a definition of the projection model, and an analysis of specimen projections.
Where \(p_{t+1,x}\) is the national rate at which women aged \(x\) at time \(t+1\) had a child aged 0-4 and \(p_{t+1,x}\) is the equivalent rate for time \(t\). The changes for the larger groups in the LFS were applied to the 1991 and 2001 common groups they contained.

Third, an annual time series of 5-year rates by ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 was obtained by averaging the results of equations (31) and (32). As examples, Figures 7(a) and (b) show ASFR trends for the White and the Bangladeshi ethnic groups between 1991 and 2009. This shows the fertility rates to be higher for Bangladeshi women in all age groups except those aged 40 and over in which a rise in rates for the White group is shown. In both groups, fertility is falling steadily for women in their 20s.

Large rises in fertility for White women in their 30s are not matched for Bangladeshi women. What about the future? Coleman and Dubuc (2010) demonstrate the usefulness of fitting a logistic curve to time trends of TFRs by ethnic group. To model variations over time in fertility by age group, we similarly fitted logistic curves to the 1991-2009 annual time series, but to each age-specific rate for each ethnic group. This procedure determines whether trends towards postponement are experienced by all ethnic groups. We extended the time series by using the fitted curves to predict age-specific rates up to 2021. These modeled curves are illustrated in Figure 7(c) and (d) for the White and Bangladeshi ethnic groups and show the trend in rates for each age group. Figures 7(e) and (f) combine the estimates and modeled curves by applying the trends of the logistic curves from the 2009 jump-off point. The reduction of rates for women in their 20s over time is clearly shown, as are the rises in rates for White women in their 30s and 40s. For Bangladeshi women over the age of 30, a continuation of rates at similar levels over time is projected.

The estimation of trends between 1991 and 2009 and curve fitting for the prediction of rates to 2021 were carried out for the eight ethnic groups common to the 1991 and 2001 Censuses. ASFRs for the more selective groups within the White and Other common groups were computed by applying growth (decline) rates for the broad group to the more selective groups they contained. We assumed that after 2021, ASFRs for each group would stay at the same level up to 2051, the final year of the projection model. When the projection was run, growth (decline) rates derived from our national time series were applied to the LA-level ASFRs by ethnic group. The relative level of fertility for local areas was therefore preserved but differences by ethnic group moved in proportion to national-level changes. The assumptions about ASFR
