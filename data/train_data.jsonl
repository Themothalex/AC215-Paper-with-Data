The mechanisms behind the income inequality\u2013mortality association remain unknown and should be the focus of future research.\nKeywords: income inequality; population health; mortality rate; panel data; developed countries\n\nIntroduction\nThe income inequality\u2013health hypothesis postulates that population health and mortality are influenced by income distribution. If supported by data, the hypothesis might help to explain why developed countries with high levels of income per head still show large differences in population health, and would also justify redistributive policies aimed at decreasing income inequality. Existing research, however, is inconclusive, possibly because the associations differ by population subgroup. The aim of the study reported in this paper was to investigate the income inequality\u2013mortality association with a focus on sex and age differences in the association.\nWith some exceptions, most recent research has been supportive of the income inequality\u2013health hypothesis. However, much of the research on income inequality and mortality has been at community and individual levels. We chose to study the income inequality\u2013mortality link at the population level because income inequality is by definition a property of the population and not of the individual; and because by studying the link at the population level we were able to take into account social and environmental factors behind the association.\nWe tested the income inequality\u2013health hypothesis using a set of panel data collected over the years 1975\u20132006 for 21 developed countries. We used mortality as the measure of population health and the high-quality Human Mortality Database as the data source. The source for the Gini index of income inequality, our income inequality measure, was the World Income Inequality Database (WIID) maintained by the United Nations University\u2013World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER). In contrast to prior work that analysed the population-level association between income inequality and mortality, we focused on developed countries only and distinguished between men and women and between age groups. Our analysis controlled for trends in gross domestic product (GDP) per head and unobserved period and country factors.\nThe main advantage of using a panel-data analysis was that it allowed us to control for all shared period factors and time-invariant country-specific factors. This has the important advantage over cross-sectional work that the results are not confounded by unobserved country heterogeneity. In addition, using our panel data, we were able to control for shared period factors, which otherwise could have been confounders, particularly in those analyses in which only a few time points were used. Although there may be yet other confounders beyond those we controlled for, such as unobserved time-varying processes not captured by trends in GDP per head, the panel-data procedure still presents an important step forward in addressing potential causality.\nOur results suggest that an increase in income inequality increases the mortality of males and females at ages 1\u201314 and 15\u201349, and the mortality of women at ages 65\u201389. These age-specific mortality effects yield observable associations between income inequality and life expectancy at birth. The effects are strongest for children and young-to-middle-aged men, and suggest that redistributive policies intended to decrease income inequality could decrease mortality among these populations.\nCountries only and distinguished between men and women and between age groups.

These age-specific mortality effects yield observable associations between income inequality and life expectancy at birth. The effects are strongest for children and young-to-middle-aged men and suggest that redistributive policies intended to decrease income inequality could decrease mortality among these populations. \n\nPrevious research at the population level has indicated that while most recent research finds an association between income inequality and health measures, especially at the individual level, the nature, magnitude, and characteristics of the association at the population level between income inequality and health are not well understood. We focus only on studies comparable to ours, and therefore only on those studies carried out at the population level. In an extensive review, out of 45 cross-country studies, 30 are supportive of the income inequality\u2013health hypothesis but 6 do not find any evidence for it. The results were most consistent for infant mortality, but less so for adult mortality.\n\nSeveral studies have pooled together data from less developed and developed countries or performed only a cross-sectional analysis that failed to control for country-specific characteristics such as welfare systems. Some of these studies found evidence for an association between income inequality and health. However, studies that focused on more homogeneous countries or that used panel-data methods to account for unobserved heterogeneity often did not find clear support for the income inequality\u2013health hypothesis. Moreover, early studies did not find the correlation between income inequality and health to differ between men and women. More recent studies find evidence that the association is stronger for women, which is at odds with findings that women\u2019s mortality is less sensitive to deprivation than that of men.\n\nData and methods\nFor our study, we used absolute inequality measures to test the income inequality\u2013health hypothesis. To analyze how mortality and life expectancy were associated with income inequality in developed nations we adopted a study design similar to that used by Shkolnikov et al. They used a country fixed-effects method and quinquennial time series to analyze the association between income inequality and variation in the age at death. We performed a panel-data analysis of age-specific mortality using fixed-effects models with data on 21 developed countries for an annual time series spanning more than 30 years, controlling for serial correlation. When selecting countries we were careful to avoid problems suspected of being the principal weaknesses of previous studies. Thus, we restricted the choice to economically developed countries and excluded countries that were part of the Soviet Bloc because of their idiosyncratic mortality trajectories following the collapse of the Soviet Union. For a list of countries included and length of the time series, please refer to the Appendix.\n\nResponse variables: life expectancy and mortality rates by age\nWe used data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD). The HMD provides internationally comparable data on mortality for national populations over long periods of time. We used life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality rates as our response variables. Life expectancy at birth summarizes the mortality experience of a synthetic cohort over the life course, thus being a concise measure of population health. The use of this measure also allows comparisons with existing research, because it has been used as the dependent variable in other comparable studies.\n\nIndependent variables: the Gini coefficient and gross domestic product (GDP) per head\nAs the key independent variable, income inequality, we used the Gini index of income inequality. Data for the Gini coefficient are taken from UNU-WIDER WIID. The coefficient is a measure of how equally income is distributed across the population. We used data on the Gini coefficient only for countries in which the income-sharing unit was the household, \u2018income\u2019 referred to disposable income, and the unit of analysis was the person. After exclusions, we had time series data for 21 countries spanning the years 1975\u20132006. \n\nFollowing Shkolnikov et al., we dealt with missing observations by simple linear interpolation. Because the Gini index evolves slowly over time, jumps and short-term fluctuations in the index are likely to be caused by measurement error rather than by changes in the true income inequality. We therefore applied a locally weighted (lowess) regression to smooth the time series that otherwise would have shown irregular variations across time.\n\nOur models controlled for income per head. Data for GDP per head in US dollars (at constant prices and parity purchasing power, reference year 2000) were collected from the OECD database, except for Taiwan (OECD 2008). For the latter, data were obtained in the same units from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) website (World Economic Outlook Database 2008). \n\nMethods\nThe data set was a time series of observations with measurements made annually. The analysis was conducted using Stata version 10. We used fixed-effects regression methods with controls for both unobserved country heterogeneity and shared time trends to estimate the association between income inequality and the dependent variable (life expectancy or mortality rate). Before the regression analysis, we took logs of the income inequality and the life expectancy/mortality variables to allow for easier interpretation and comparison of the size of the estimated coefficients, and to control for heteroscedasticity and achieve linearity. \n\nWe used panel-data regression techniques to estimate the effect of income inequality on mortality. The regressions controlled for GDP per head, and fixed effects by country and time. The fixed effects by country controlled for unobserved factors that differed between countries but were constant over time for each country (e.g., welfare systems, geographic, and environmental differences). The time-fixed effects controlled for unobserved factors shared by all countries at a specific point in time that were not accounted for by GDP per head. In addition, we adjusted the model to account for autocorrelation.\nThe Gini coefficient measures income inequality and ranges between 0 and 1: the closer the coefficient is to 1, the higher the degree of inequality. The advantage of using the Gini coefficient is that data are relatively easily available. The literature suggests that the association between income inequality and mortality is robust to the choice of the income inequality measure (Kawachi and Kennedy 1997).\n\nWe used data on the Gini coefficient only for countries in which the income-sharing unit was the household, 'income' referred to disposable income, and the unit of analysis was the person. Of all OECD countries for which data were available from the UNU-WIDER database, we excluded Australia from the analysis because the data referred to a person instead of a household as the income-sharing unit. We also excluded Japan because the Gini data suggested surprising fluctuations and a falling trend over time, which was not consistent with published findings (Jones 2007). After these exclusions, we had time series data for 21 countries spanning the years 1975\u20132006.\n\nFollowing Shkolnikov et al. (2009), we dealt with missing observations by simple linear interpolation. Because the Gini index evolves slowly over time, jumps and short-term fluctuations in the index are likely to be caused by measurement error rather than by changes in the true income inequality. We therefore applied a locally weighted (lowess) regression to smooth the time series that otherwise would have shown irregular variations across time (Solt 2009).\n\nOur models controlled for income per head. Data for GDP per head in US dollars (at constant prices and parity purchasing power, reference year 2000) were collected from the OECD database, except for Taiwan (OECD 2008). For the latter, data were obtained in the same units from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) website (World Economic Outlook Database 2008).\n\nMethods\nThe data set was a time series of observations with measurements made annually. The analysis was conducted using Stata version 10. We used fixed-effects regression methods with controls for both unobserved country heterogeneity and shared time trends to estimate the association between income inequality and the dependent variable (life expectancy or mortality rate). Before the regression analysis, we took logs of the income inequality and the life expectancy/mortality variables to allow for easier interpretation and comparison of the size of the estimated coefficients and to control for heteroscedasticity and achieve linearity.\n\nWe used panel-data regression techniques to estimate the effect of income inequality on mortality. The regressions controlled for GDP per head, and fixed effects by country and time. The fixed effects by country controlled for unobserved factors that differed between countries but were constant over time for each country (e.g., welfare systems, geographic, and environmental differences). The time-fixed effects controlled for unobserved factors shared by all countries at a specific point in time that were not accounted for by GDP per head. In addition, we adjusted the model to account for autocorrelation. The following equation shows the regression model:\n\n\\[ In Y_{it} = a + b_1 In GDP_{it} + b_2 In Gini_{it} + \\tau_i + \\gamma_t + \\epsilon_{it} \\]\n\nwith \\[ \\epsilon_{it} = q \\epsilon_{it-1} + g_{it} \\]\n\nwhere Y denotes the dependent variable (life expectancy at birth or age-specific mortality rate) for country i at time t; GDP is the control variable for income per head of country i at time t; Gini is the index of income inequality for country i at time t and represents the main explanatory variable; \\(\\tau_i\\) is the country heterogeneity term that is constant over time; \\(\\gamma_t\\) is a period dummy capturing time-fixed effects (5-year intervals starting from 1975 with the exception of 2000\u201306, for which the interval was 7 years long); and \\(\\epsilon_{it}\\) is the error term which we allowed to be serially correlated (AR(1) structure).\nRates for males are approximately twice that of females. Table 2 shows bivariate correlations for the main variables. The Gini coefficient is negatively correlated with life expectancy at birth (significant for men, not for women) and positively correlated with mortality rate for both men and women up to age 50. At ages 50\u201364, the correlation becomes insignificant and at ages 65\u201389 changes sign and is negatively correlated with mortality. Overall, the bivariate correlations suggest that a higher level of income inequality is linked to lower life expectancy at birth and higher mortality rates below age 50. For GDP per head, the results are similar for men and women, and suggest that higher average income is associated with increased life expectancy and decreased mortality in all age groups.\n\nRegression results Table 3 reports the results of the regressions of life expectancy and age-specific mortality on the Gini coefficient. All models control for GDP per head, and fixed effects for country and time, and allow for autocorrelation in the residuals. Figure 1 illustrates the key results shown in Table 3.\n\nTable 3 presents the estimates for the twelve models used (six response variables, two sexes). Each row shows the estimates for one response variable, with results reported separately for men and for women. Each column shows the explanatory variables introduced in a model. The first row shows the association between life expectancy at birth, Gini coefficient, and GDP per head. For both men and women, the Gini coefficient has a negative sign and is statistically significant, suggesting that there is an inverse relation between income inequality and life expectancy. The control variable GDP per head is strongly associated with life expectancy, and the association is in the opposite direction to that of income inequality. The association is also markedly stronger than that of income inequality.\n\nOther rows in Table 3 show results from regression models with age-specific mortality rates regressed on the Gini index and GDP per head. We do not observe a statistically significant association between income inequality and infant mortality for either men or women. For men, we observe positive and significant coefficients for the Gini index from age 1 up to age 49. Above this age, the coefficients are small, negative, and statistically insignificant. For women, the coefficients are positive at ages 1\u201349 and at old ages, 65\u201389. For the control variable GDP per head, we observe both among men and women a consistently negative and significant association with all age-specific mortality rates.\n\nAt ages 15\u201349, the mortality coefficient for males for the Gini index is still positive (0.252) and significant (p < 0.05). For women aged 15\u201349 the coefficient is much smaller (0.145). At old ages (65\u201389), the income inequality\u2013mortality association is significant only for women. Robustness checks We confirmed that the results were robust to the exclusion of single countries (i.e., the exclusion from the model of each country in turn).\n\nDiscussion Rodgers (1979) and Wilkinson (1992) were among the first to provide evidence for the negative association between income inequality and population health, but the association has not been confirmed by some recent research that used longitudinal data (Mellor and Milyo 2001; Beckfield 2004). Our results suggest that income inequality matters more at younger ages so that the association between income inequality and mortality is strongest for children aged 1\u201314 and young adults aged 15\u201349. We were unable to confirm a positive association between income inequality and infant mortality.\nThe coefficient is slightly larger, but because child mortality is higher for men than for women, the absolute effect is slightly smaller than that for men. The UK\u2019s experience is an illuminating example of the effect of an increase in the Gini index: a 43 per cent increase in income inequality, which was observed in the UK over the period 1975\u20132006, would correspond to a 10.6 per cent increase in child mortality for boys and a 12.6 per cent increase for girls. However, since the mortality rate at ages 1\u201314 is lower for women than for men (in our data, on average 25 per cent lower), the absolute effect is greater for men.\n\nAt ages 15\u201349, the mortality coefficient for males for the Gini index is still positive (0.252) and significant (p < 0.05). For women aged 15\u201349, the coefficient is much smaller (0.145). Again, the UK\u2019s experience is a useful example: a 43 per cent increase in the Gini index would correspond to a 9.4 per cent increase in the mortality of males. For men, the average mortality rate in the data is 1.9/1,000 at ages 15\u201349, and a 9.4 per cent increase would take it to 2.1/1,000. Given the UK\u2019s population size and age structure (around 15 million men and women aged between 15 and 49 years), these mortality changes would correspond to approximately 2,700 excess deaths of males and 700 excess deaths of females at ages 15\u201349. Conversely, if the Gini coefficient declined from 30 per cent (the average in our data) to 20 per cent (the minimum in our data) for this population, a decrease of 33 per cent, with baseline mortality rates corresponding to the average in our sample, the number of lives saved in the age range 15\u201349 would be approximately 2,900 for men and 800 for women.\n\nAt old ages (65\u201389), the income inequality\u2013mortality association is significant only for women. The coefficient 0.149 implies that an increase of 43 per cent in income inequality is associated with a 5.5 per cent increase in mortality. While significant, this increase is markedly smaller than the increases observed at ages 1\u201314 for both sexes, or for men at ages 15\u201349.\n\nWe confirmed that the results were robust to the exclusion of single countries (i.e., the exclusion from the model of each country in turn). By re-estimating the models without time controls, we also confirmed that the inclusion of time-fixed effects influenced the results only marginally. We tested an alternative, more parsimonious specification of the time control by using a linear shared trend, and found that the key results did not change. Finally, we estimated the models with income inequality lagged by one year. The results did not change in any significant manner.\n\nRodgers (1979) and Wilkinson (1992) were among the first to provide evidence for the negative association between income inequality and population health, but the association has not been confirmed by some recent research that used longitudinal data. Recently, Shkolnikov et al. (2009) used longitudinal data to analyze the association between income inequality and variation in age at death and found that income inequality explained inter-country but not within-country differences. We analyzed the association between income inequality and mortality by sex in 21 developed countries for the period 1975\u20132006 and found income inequality to be an important predictor of the mortality of males and females at ages 1\u201314 and 15\u201349, and of mortality of females at ages 65\u201389. These results shed new light on the income inequality\u2013health hypothesis. They differ from several earlier results, possibly because we focused only on developed countries, excluded transition economies, used panel-data models which allow controlling for unobserved country effects, and measured the effects separately for males and females and for different age groups.\nIn summary, our results show that in developed countries, income inequality has an important effect on child and adult mortality and that there are sex differences for adults. The importance of average income, however, is greater than that of income distribution. Our results suggest that recent skepticism (Gravelle et al. 2002; Lynch and Smith 2002) about the income inequality\u2013health hypothesis needs to be reconsidered. While our population-level analysis cannot disentangle the factors underlying the concave association between income and individual health, it shows that mortality among children and young adults is lower in societies where income distribution is relatively equal than in those in which it is unequal. Moreover, income distribution is associated more closely with the mortality of young adult males than with that of females\u2014an interesting sex difference worthy of further study. Given the importance of health for productivity as well as the sustainability of an ageing society, redistributive policies aimed at reducing income inequality might yield generally benign social effects in addition to improved population health.\nPampel, F.

The main predictor was an innovative measure of household wealth that captures changes in wealth over time. Discrete-time logistic models (with community fixed effects) were used to examine mortality and malnutrition outcomes: infant, child, and under-5 mortality; stunting, wasting, and being underweight. Analysis was conducted at the national, urban/rural, and regional levels, separately for boys and girls. The results indicate that the relationship between household wealth and under-5 mortality weakened over time but this result was dominated by infant mortality. The relationship between wealth and child mortality stayed strong for girls. The relationship between household wealth and malnutrition became stronger over time for boys and particularly for girls, in urban and (especially) rural areas.\n\nKeywords: India; 1990s; NFHS; wealth index; infant mortality; child mortality; under-5 mortality; stunting; wasting; underweight\n\nIntroduction\nImproving child health remains an important challenge in much of the less developed world, including India. However, India has made some progress in recent decades. The under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) has been declining steadily. In 2005-06, the U5MR was 74 deaths per 1,000 live births, down from 95 per 1,000 in 1998-99 and 109 per 1,000 in 1992-93. These estimates, which come from the National Family Health Surveys (NFHSs), differ slightly from the official estimates based on Sample Registration System data. The latter estimates actually show an increase in child mortality between the late 1990s and mid-2000s, but have been shown to be in need of correction. The corrected official estimates corroborate the findings from NFHSs and show a very modest decline in infant mortality but close to a halving in child mortality. Declines in malnutrition were much smaller. Our own calculations show that in 1992-93, 55 percent of children were stunted, compared to 51 percent in 1998-99 and 46 percent in 2005-06. Similarly, in 1992-93, 48 percent of children were underweight, compared to 43 percent in 1998-99 and 40 percent in 2005-06. These improvements occurred during a time of immense economic growth in India, though there is considerable debate on whether all groups benefited evenly from the economic growth. At the heart of this debate lies the question of whether the structural adjustment programme of the early 1990s had desirable or undesirable consequences. The economic reforms initiated as part of this programme emphasized globalization, liberalization, and privatization, with the implicit retreat of the state. Some have argued that these new policies had an adverse effect on poverty reduction. Moreover, most scholars agree that there were increases in inequality at the national level, within and between states, and within and between rural and urban areas during this time.\n\nGiven that child health is closely tied to economic welfare, these macro-level trends in child health and poverty prompt the question of what happened at the micro level or household level. If the role of the state indeed diminished, were household factors increasingly responsible for producing improvements in child survival and nutritional status? Public spending directly or indirectly subsidizes the cost of a household procuring better health outcomes for its children. If it is true that India\u2019s recent economic growth was not pro-poor, and in fact involved a reduction in these subsidies to poorer people, household wealth should have become more important over the years as a factor in improving child health. With these considerations in mind, we examined how the role of household wealth as a determinant of child health evolved between the mid-1980s and mid-2000s. India has experienced dramatic macroeconomic changes in recent decades, accompanied by microeconomic changes in the welfare of households, all of which served as the backdrop for the analyses described in this paper.\nA household procuring better health outcomes for its children is linked to economic growth and poverty dynamics in India. If recent growth was not pro-poor, involving reductions in subsidies to poorer people, household wealth should have become more important over the years as a factor in improving child health. We examined how the role of household wealth as a determinant of child health evolved between the mid-1980s and mid-2000s, a period of significant macroeconomic changes in India.\n\nIndia\u2019s economic growth over the past three decades has been notable. The period starting in the mid-1980s saw the beginnings of deregulation and an increase in domestic demand, leading to gross domestic product (GDP) growth coupled with declines in poverty. In the 1980s, economic growth might have left the poor behind, leading to an increase in overall inequality. However, evidence suggests that macroeconomic growth benefited people near the poverty line and was not linked to noticeable increases in inequality.\n\nThe growth in GDP continued into the 1990s, but the decade started with a fiscal crisis that necessitated a series of economic reforms. These included fiscal consolidation, tax reforms, agricultural sector reforms, and policy changes related to industry, foreign investment, trade, exchange rates, and the public and financial sectors. The impact of these reforms on poverty and inequality in the 1990s is less clear than in the 1980s.\n\nThe role of the state has been significant, especially in light of economic reforms that emphasized privatization, liberalization, and globalization. The Coburn thesis urges examining the causes of socioeconomic status (SES) inequalities, rooted in the rise of neoliberalism and its impact on the welfare state. In India, the role of the state diminished following the reforms. Public investment in health as a percentage of GDP declined from 1.05 percent in 1985-86 to just 0.90 percent by 2000-01.\n\nThis decline in state spending on health and other welfare measures has critical implications for child health, as state interventions in food security, infrastructure, disease control, and subsidies complement household investments in child health. A large portion of health spending, between 65-75 percent, comes from households, which is significantly higher than in both low-income and developed countries, making India\u2019s healthcare spending pattern exceptional.\n\nOur study examines shifts over time in the role that household wealth plays in influencing child survival and nutrition, hypothesizing that household wealth has become a more important determinant of child health. We also explore economic and geographic disparities in child health, which could indicate missed opportunities for public interventions aimed at improving equity. Previous studies have documented the positive relationship between wealth and child health; our analysis builds on this by examining both mortality and malnutrition with a consistent methodological approach across urban and rural areas.\n\nData for our analysis came from the National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) in India, conducted in 1992-93, 1998-99, and 2005-06, covering a nationally representative sample of women and households across various states of India. These surveys provide data on assets, housing characteristics, and comprehensive birth histories, which form the basis of our wealth measures and analysis of child health outcomes.\n\nFindings analogous to those of Chalasani (2012) were shown in another study by Pathak and Singh (2011), who used three NFHSs to demonstrate inequalities in the proportion of underweight individuals at the national and regional levels. Bivariate analyses, poor-rich ratios, and concentration indices were utilized to measure inequality. Pooled logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the adjusted effect of economic status on the likelihood of being underweight. Their results indicated a rise in economic inequalities in being underweight during the period between 1992 and 2006. Another study utilizing NFHS-1 and -2 found significant improvements in short-term measures of child nutritional status across all of India, as well as sizable long-term performance improvements in urban areas. However, these changes hid large differences between the sexes, especially in rural India. The change in the distribution of weight-for-height z-scores was about twice as large for boys as it was for girls. While boys\u2019 height performances showed a relatively small improvement, for girls there was an almost spectacular worsening (Tarozzi and Mahajan 2007).\n\nOur analysis contributes to this literature on the relationship between household-level economic factors and child health in several ways. The biggest contribution, particularly given the Indian context, is the separate analysis for boys and girls, which uncovered several critical differences in levels and trends. Secondly, examining both mortality (especially at different ages) and malnutrition outcomes with the same data and analytic methods led to some key inferences that might not have been apparent had we studied any one of these types of outcomes alone. Because of the uniformity in approach, our inferences could be made more confidently, and cannot be ascribed to differences in data and method. Thirdly, breaking down the results by urban/rural area, as well as region, revealed pathways through which the effects were operating. Finally, the innovative wealth measure we created enabled us to examine changes in the wealth-child health relationship over time.\n\nThe data for the analysis came from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) series, known as the National Family Health Surveys in India. Interviews were conducted as follows: In 1992-93 with a 99 percent nationally representative sample of 89,777 ever-married women aged 13-49 in 24 states and Delhi (then a union territory). In 1998-99, interviews involved 89,199 ever-married women aged 15-49 in 26 states, including the newly included state of Sikkim and the Kashmir region of Jammu and Kashmir, with Delhi having become a state. In 2005-06, interviews were conducted with 124,385 women aged 15-49 in the 29 states of India, where Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Uttarakhand were carved out of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa, respectively. Small union territories were excluded in all three surveys.\n\nIn NFHS-1, height was not measured in five states but national estimates were not affected. Regional findings for height closely matched findings for weight, reflecting the data tabulated from responses to the women\u2019s and household questionnaires. Information on children came from the complete birth history recorded for all interviewed women. Information on assets and housing characteristics, which formed the basis of the wealth measure, came from the household questionnaire. \nThe logit function could then be written as log h(t | x) = 1 / (1 - h(t | x)) = b0 + b1x1 + ... + bkxk which is the ratio of the probability of occurrence of death to the probability of its non-occurrence. The hazard function is represented by h(t | x). The logit coefficients bk represent the relationship of each covariate to the log odds of death. Exponentiating these coefficients yields the increase or decrease in the odds of death associated with a change in the respective covariate. The logit discrete-time model makes the assumption that the baseline hazard is flat, whereas in all likelihood, the hazard probability changes with age. To account for this duration dependence, we included first- and second-order temporal dummy variables in the regression.\n\nFixed-effects logistic model\n\nThe regression model does not include any information about the larger context that the children live in, beyond the family and the household. Features of communities can have an impact on child outcomes. Characteristics of these communities that are related to household wealth levels but are also related to child health will be captured in the error term, thus violating the fundamental regression assumption that the independent variables in the model and the error term are uncorrelated. In order to address this problem of unobserved group-level heterogeneity, we also present results from a fixed-effects model. We included fixed effects at the community or primary sampling unit (PSU) level.\n\nClustering\n\nWe used an estimator of variance that is robust to the fact that cluster samples, unlike simple random samples, violate the assumption of independence of observations. Households are not drawn randomly from a listing of all households in the country. Rather, households are chosen randomly within a cluster, thus violating the assumption of independence of observations, and leading to incorrect estimates of the standard errors. Parameter estimates are not affected by this violation. The robust variance estimator was specified using the vce (cluster) option in Stata 11. Cluster membership was specified using the cluster ID as the group-membership variable.\n\nWeighting\n\nThe principal components analyses were conducted using household data and were consequently weighted using the normal household weights. The regression analyses would have used the woman weights but the weights provided in the NFHS are usually normalized, that is, the sampling weight is multiplied by the sampling fraction. When data are pooled for the regression analysis, these weights are no longer correct and must be de-normalized. Since the woman files from all three NFHS surveys were pooled for the multivariable analysis, weights needed to be adjusted. The factor by which weights were multiplied was a product of the following ratios: (i) ratio of the mid-year population of women aged 15-49 to the number of women in the corresponding survey year, and (ii) ratio of the total number of women in the pooled sample to the sum of the mid-year populations of women aged 15-49 in 1992, 1998, and 2005.\nOver time the data points generally move rightward and downward, indicating increases in median wealth, especially in urban areas, and decreases in mortality rates. The regional graphs show that both in the North and Central regions, where son preference tends to be the strongest, infant mortality is as high as or higher for girls than it is for boys (despite the usually higher biological vulnerability of boys). There are also large gaps between the child mortality lines for boys and girls in several regions, with girls always experiencing higher child mortality than boys.\n\nThe graphs for malnutrition at the national level show that the data points for urban areas lie to the right of and higher than the points for rural areas. This implies that urban children come from wealthier households and are fewer standard deviations below the reference median than rural children, both in terms of height and weight for age. Over time the data points move marginally upward, more in urban areas than rural areas, indicating increases in median wealth and slight decreases in malnutrition. At the regional level, there is wide variation in malnutrition and wealth levels. Notice, for example, the distinctly different appearances of the graphs from the Central and the Eastern regions on the one hand and the Western and Southern regions on the other.\n\nTo understand trends in child health more easily, mortality rates and proportion malnourished in each of the three survey years, at the national and regional levels, respectively. Many exceptions to a secular decline emerge. In urban areas, there was stagnation in the 1990s in infant mortality among boys and in child mortality among girls. In rural areas, there was stagnation in the 1990s in child mortality for both boys and girls. In the North and Central regions, infant and child mortality remained unchanged in the 1990s for both sexes. Even in the more prosperous regions, there was some flatlining. In the West, for example, infant mortality among boys did not decline in the 1990s, and neither infant nor child mortality among girls declined in the 2000s. In the South, infant mortality among girls stagnated in the 1990s, and child mortality seems to have increased in the 1990s.\n\nTrends in the percentage malnourished echo the graphs of z-scores. In both urban and rural areas, boys experienced declines of approximately 10 percentage points in stunting and being underweight, but there were much smaller declines for girls, particularly in rural areas. In the North, there were no improvements in the 1990s in stunting or being underweight for either boys or girls. In the Central as well as Eastern regions, only girls did not experience improvements in either outcome in the 1990s; in addition, boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 underweight levels remained unchanged in the 2000s. In the West, for both boys and girls, there were no real improvements in stunting between the first and third surveys, nor in being underweight in the 1990s.\nIncreases in median wealth and slight decreases in malnutrition are observed. At the regional level, there is wide variation in malnutrition and wealth levels. Notice, for example, the distinctly different appearances of the graphs from the Central and the Eastern regions on the one hand and the Western and Southern regions on the other.\n\nTo understand trends in child health more easily, mortality rates and proportion malnourished in each of the three survey years are shown at the national and regional levels, respectively.

This indicates a clear wealth gradient in health: with few exceptions, poorer groups experience higher mortality and malnutrition than wealthier groups. Across years, there were absolute declines in mortality from 1992 to 2005 in every wealth group. The declines among poorer quintiles were larger for boys than girls. The excess mortality burden borne by the poor declined, contrasting with malnutrition, which did not always decline for every group, particularly not for girls. The relatively larger declines occurred among the richer quintiles, especially pronounced for girls.\n\nIn the next section, results from the regression framework are presented. Odds ratios can be interpreted as the effect of a one standard deviation change in the wealth score. Remember that the wealth predictor was a continuous wealth score. Since a unit increase in this wealth score is somewhat difficult to interpret, a standardized version was used in the regressions. This shows summary statistics for the unstandardized wealth scores at each level of geographic aggregation.\nTable 1B\nMortality, malnutrition, and means of determinants at the regional level in India

Urban areas have lower maximum and minimum values than rural areas, but medians are always higher in urban areas. Further, the median is higher than the mean in urban areas, implying that the data are left-skewed, with a long tail of low wealth scores pulling down the mean. On the other hand, the mean is higher than the median in rural areas, implying that the data are right-skewed, with the bulk of the population having low wealth but a long tail of higher wealth scores pulling up the mean. The mean and median increased everywhere over time, for both boys and girls. The range is larger in rural areas and more rural regions like the Central and Eastern regions.\n\nMultivariate analysis shows that the odds ratios associating wealth with all outcomes are generally below 1.0, corroborating what is generally known about children from wealthier households having lower odds of dying or being malnourished. Focusing first on under-5 mortality at the national level, in 1992 a one-standard-deviation increase in the wealth score resulted in a 25 per cent decline in the odds of mortality for boys and an 18 per cent decline for girls. By 2005, a one-standard-deviation increase led to only a 14 per cent decline in the odds for boys, with no significant change for girls. The national pattern is dominated by the rural pattern. Wealth effects on under-5 mortality are stronger in rural areas than urban areas. At the regional level, the picture is much more mixed, and clear patterns are not evident, indicating that the urban-rural division may be a more appropriate analytical grouping.\n\nWe then unpacked under-5 mortality to study mortality in smaller age intervals. Wealth effects are much weaker for infant mortality than for child mortality. The patterns in infant mortality mirror those in under-5 mortality because the former is a dominant component of the latter. Wealth coefficients for infant mortality are significant for the first two surveys in rural areas but no significant effects remain by the third survey. Interestingly, in all three surveys, wealth does not seem to be the major driver of infant mortality in urban areas. Wealth effects are larger for child mortality. However, even those effects are attenuated by the third survey for boys, in both urban and rural areas. For girls, however, wealth effects on child mortality remain strong. At the regional level, effects of wealth on child mortality emerge across regions with very divergent profiles\u2014North and South for boys; Central, West, and South for girls.\n\nWe now turn to malnutrition. Of the three outcomes, wealth is most strongly correlated with being underweight followed by stunting and then wasting. Wealth is associated with malnutrition in both urban and rural areas, for both boys and girls. All regions show large wealth effects especially for stunting and being underweight, with the strongest effects shown in the West. No major sex differences emerge in any region. In terms of trends, at the national level wealth effects remained robust for boys, and became larger for girls in later surveys, particularly in rural areas (odds ratios moved further below 1.0). At the regional level, wealth effects on malnutrition for boys strengthened over time in the Northern, Central, and Eastern regions especially between the first two surveys, and for girls in every region except the South.\n\nCommunity fixed-effects models show that, for mortality at the national level, compared to the model without fixed effects, wealth effects on infant mortality are stronger in rural areas for both boys and girls, but wealth effects on child mortality are no longer significant. Effects at the regional level echo the national patterns: the inclusion of fixed effects renders wealth coefficients insignificant except in the case of infant mortality in poorer, more rural regions like the Central and Eastern regions. Adding fixed effects to the malnutrition models bolsters wealth effects at the national level and does not affect regional results.\n\nDiscussion reveals that household wealth is an important predictor of mortality in all three surveys, but the associations are weaker for mortality at younger ages. This finding is consistent with the general literature. Variations in the causes of death at younger and older ages may explain the differences in the strength of wealth as a predictor of mortality. Older children have longer exposure time to their socioeconomic and physical environment, which possibly gives factors like household wealth more power to affect child survival. Wealth is also an important predictor of nutritional status, which is very much a function of constant household-level inputs such as food and health care. Wealth is associated with malnutrition in both urban and rural areas, underscoring the widespread nature of the malnutrition problem in India. Being underweight was the outcome most strongly associated with household wealth. Weight-for-age as a measure presents the advantage of reflecting both past and current malnutrition. This means that it is more responsive to short-term changes in inputs to health and current wealth status of the household. The correlation of household wealth with stunting was slightly weaker. Stunting is an indicator of past growth failure and is considered irreversible beyond the age of 2, and may thus not exhibit as close a correlation as being underweight with a current measure of household wealth.\n\nThe addition of community fixed effects to the models intensifies the association of wealth with infant mortality in rural areas, and with malnutrition in urban as well as rural areas. This indicates that the associations of household wealth with these outcomes in these areas are not an artifact of unobserved community-level factors. Stated differently, community-level factors have some sort of equalizing effect, and controlling for them underscores wealth-based inequality in outcomes even more. Especially in rural areas, where the availability of services like antenatal care and skilled delivery may be less consistent, wealth plays a crucial role in affecting health outcomes.\nVariations in the causes of death at younger and older ages may explain the differences in the strength of wealth as a predictor of mortality.

Stated differently, community-level factors have some sort of equalizing effect, and controlling for them underscores wealth-based inequality in outcomes even more. Especially in rural areas, where the availability of services like antenatal care and skilled delivery attendants is sparse, household wealth can make a big difference to infant survival. Wealth effects on malnutrition remain strong even after controlling for community-level factors, a finding that shows how heavily nutritional status can be dependent on household-level inputs. Fixed effects do diminish the association of wealth with child mortality but this by no means implies that household wealth does not matter to child survival. A household\u2019s neighborhood is not exogenous; after all, wealthier households can move to better neighborhoods, and the fixed-effects results could be reflecting this kind of selectivity. Care must be taken to not treat the results from the fixed-effects model as though they are \u2018more correct\u2019 than results from a simple model.\n\nOur hypothesis was that the relationship between household wealth and child health would strengthen over time. We found that this was true in the case of malnutrition but not in the case of mortality. Wealth effects on mortality declined over time, except for the mortality of female children, for which coefficients stayed strong. The weakening trend in wealth effects on infant mortality suggests that it is not as dependent on private wealth as it was before. This corroborates aggregate-level findings in another study, and our results demonstrated that it is true for boys as well as girls. As infant mortality rates decline, infants who die may be a somewhat more selective group, increasingly comprising those who are inherently more vulnerable and thus less affected by external factors like household wealth. This trend could also have been influenced by the universally subsidizing effect of public programs aimed at reducing mortality among children, specifically the Universal Immunization Program, followed by the Child Survival and Safe Motherhood Program, and finally the Reproductive and Child Health Program. These successful programs could have partially offset investments that households might otherwise have had to make. Survival between the ages of 1 and 4 demands sustained investments, which tend to come from the household, possibly resulting in wealth effects continuing to be strong across surveys. Lending support to this argument is the finding of especially strong effects on child mortality for girls in rural areas, who may be accorded lower priority for intra-household investment in poor, resource-constrained families. A potential selection issue arises when considering sex-selective abortion, and whether the more \u2018wanted\u2019 children who are being born as a result have lower mortality, driving the findings on mortality. This seems especially possible when looking at the improvements in child mortality among girls from wealthier rural households. Sex-selective abortion does occur disproportionately among wealthier, better-educated Hindu women. However, we know that there is no differential pattern of decline for infant mortality, and even the poorer groups do experience large declines in child mortality, rendering this explanation unlikely.\n\nFor malnutrition, there is a pattern of steady wealth effects for boys and intensifying wealth effects for girls, in urban as well as rural areas. This generally aligns with the findings of other researchers. Subramanyam et al. found that at the national level, social disparities in undernutrition over a 14-year period either widened or stayed the same. Pathak and Singh found that the decline in the rate of malnutrition among the poor was not as significant as among the richer groups, highlighting an increasing inequality in nutritional status based on socioeconomic status.\nAttendants is sparse, household wealth can make a big difference to infant survival.

However, separating boys from girls in our analysis revealed that the findings from these studies are partially driven by gender differences. Another selection issue arises when considering whether child malnutrition did not decline much, especially among the poor, because more children were now surviving.\n\nAn issue that merits discussion is the performance during this period of two large public programs relevant to child nutrition\u2014the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) and the Public Distribution System (PDS). While the ICDS has been praised as being well-conceived and well-placed to address the major causes of malnutrition, some key mismatches between the program\u2019s intentions and its implementation have been identified. One of these mismatches is that children from wealthier households participate more than children from poorer households, and the program is only partially succeeding in targeting the most vulnerable children, for example, girls and children from lower castes. Furthermore, central government allocations to the ICDS scarcely increased in the years corresponding to the period between the first two surveys. The PDS provides wheat, rice, and sugar at affordable prices to families to enhance food security. It is India\u2019s most far-reaching safety net.\nTable 5B\nRelationship between wealth and mortality and malnutrition at the regional level in India (odds ratios from fixed effects/conditional logistic regressions)\n\nNorth\nCentral\nEast\nBoys\nGirls\nBoys\nGirls\nBoys\nGirls\nMortality\nInfant\nWealth*1992\n0.90\n0.85\n0.79\n0.88\n0.65\n0.64*\nWealth*1998\n0.70*\n0.69\n0.70*\n0.84\n0.80\n0.60*\nWealth*2005\n0.82\n0.76\n0.80\n0.70*\n1.02\n0.87\nChild\nWealth*1992\n0.27\n0.39\n0.50\n0.45\n0.55\n0.95\nWealth*1998\n1.14\n0.45\n0.26\n0.83\n0.82\n0.37\nWealth*2005\n0.26\n0.32\n1.35\n0.49\n1.10\n0.55\nUnder-5\nWealth*1992\n0.84\n0.74\n0.75\n0.75\n0.63*\n0.61*\nWealth*1998\n0.66*\n0.63**\n0.66**\n0.75*\n0.77\n0.53**\nWealth*2005\n0.75\n0.67\n0.78\n0.63**\n1.02\n0.79\n\nNorth-east\nWest\nSouth\nBoys\nGirls\nBoys\nGirls\nBoys\nGirls\nMortality\nInfant\nWealth*1992\n0.58\n0.59\n0.68\n1.00\n0.71\n0.65\nWealth*1998\n0.91\n0.72\n0.65\n0.89\n1.01\n0.73\nWealth*2005\n0.89\n0.88\n0.58\n0.79\n0.84\n1.00\nChild\nWealth*1992\n0.30\n0.14\n0.21\n0.54\n0.71\n0.17\nWealth*1998\n0.34\n0.54\n0.79\n0.18\n0.15\n0.40\nWealth*2005\n3.73\n0.06\n0.86\n0.03\n0.23\n0.27\nUnder-5\nWealth*1992\n0.49\n0.51\n0.60\n0.93\n0.70\n0.62\nWealth*1998\n0.81\n0.67\n0.65\n0.71\n0.88\n0.74\nWealth*2005\n0.98\n0.84\n0.63\n0.67\n0.78\n0.94\n\nNorth\nCentral\nEast\nBoys\nGirls\nBoys\nGirls\nBoys\nGirls\nMalnutrition\nStunting\nWealth*1992\n0.72*\n0.69*\n0.68*\n1.02\n0.83\n0.80\nWealth*1998\n0.69**\n0.64***\n0.56***\n0.66**\n0.61***\n0.65***\nWealth*2005\n0.51***\n0.59**\n0.68***\n0.67***\n0.52***b\n0.62***\nWasting\nWealth*1992\n0.82\n0.84\n1.02\n0.82\n0.78\n0.80\nWealth*1998\n0.60**\n0.75\n0.82\n0.82\n0.82\n0.72\nWealth*2005\n0.84\n0.76\n0.73**\n0.74*\n0.78\n0.83\nUnderweight\nWealth*1992\n0.64**\n0.67*\n0.67*\n0.83\n0.72\n0.76\nWealth*1998\n0.59***\n0.58***\n0.64***\n0.66**\n0.63***\n0.61***\nWealth*2005\n0.57**\n0.54**\n0.61***\n0.61***\n0.52***\n0.69***\n\nNorth-east\nWest\nSouth\nBoys\nGirls\nBoys\nGirls\nBoys\nGirls\nMalnutrition\nStunting\nWealth*1992\n0.65\n0.47\n0.59**\n0.83\n0.58**\n0.47**\nWealth*1998\n0.75\n0.78\n0.49**\n0.66\n0.59***\n0.69**\nWealth*2005\n0.60**\n0.62*\n0.54**\n0.54*\n0.78\n0.52***\nWasting\nWealth*1992\n0.95\n0.45\n0.66\n0.83\n0.80\n0.65\nWealth*1998\n0.80\n0.71\n0.57\n0.68\n0.74\n0.81\nWealth*2005\n0.89\n0.94\n0.79\n0.67\n0.76\n0.83\nUnderweight\nWealth*1992\n0.50\n0.33\n0.53**\n0.63\n0.63*\n0.54\nWealth*1998\n0.68\n0.60\n0.45**\n0.56*\n0.53***\n0.67**\nWealth*2005\n0.56*\n0.61*\n0.58**\n0.43**\n0.62***\n0.60**\nMeasure multiple dimensions of household economic well-being and trends in those dimensions. Second, the wealth score is more a measure of long-term rather than short-term economic welfare. This matters if child survival and nutrition are more responsive to short-term measures of welfare such as household income. Third, a major assumption in the construction of this measure was that the functional form linking household wealth to asset ownership remains constant over time. This may not be true, and if it is not then our measure of wealth is not really comparable across years. However, the findings on mother\u2019s education are encouraging, as are findings using a different construction of the wealth index. Households from all three surveys were pooled, and one ranking was created for all of them. While all the wealth coefficients tended to be significant in models using this pooled wealth index, trends in the size of coefficients were very similar to the results presented here. Fourth, we also assumed that the functional form linking household wealth to child health did not change. Fifth, which is more a clarification, is that the income of each of the groups we used in Table 2, is probably changing year to year. Finally, although our hypothesis stemmed from an observation of economic growth and general indicators of a change in the role of the state, we did not conduct a direct test of the role of government and public programs, and thus cannot report directly on the influence of those factors on our main effects of interest.\n\nConclusion\n\nFuture extensions of this research could include additional tests of the central hypothesis about changes in the wealth-health link. One could test for changes in the effects of household wealth on such outcomes as antenatal care, immunization, and giving birth in a health care facility or with assistance from a skilled attendant. These factors can be seen as being on the pathway from wealth to child health. The changing effects of wealth may well be capturing changes in patterns of usage of antenatal and delivery care, and immunization. Moreover, policy can have an impact on such services, and thus reduce the burden of purchasing them on households. Another important extension would be a decomposition analysis to partition the sources of change in mortality and malnutrition into changes in the levels of the determinants vs. changes in the slopes, in order to identify the relative importance of the sources of change.\n\nThe numbers presented in this paper tell a compelling story. While mortality and malnutrition among children have both declined, household wealth still plays a crucial role in ensuring desirable outcomes. The right programs can improve child health while simultaneously decreasing the burden on households. The fraction of under-5 mortality attributable to infant mortality has increased over time. In order to achieve further mortality reductions, it will be essential to improve the quality of health care and equity in the provision of medical services. Malnutrition continues to be very high in India even compared with other less developed regions; again underscoring the crucial role that policy and programs can play.\nTarozzi, Alessandro and Aprajit Mahajan. 2007.

Historical data from six German villages were used to assess how socio-economic conditions and short-term economic crises following poor harvests may have affected maternal mortality. The results show that one year after an increase in grain prices, the risk of maternal death increased significantly amongst the wives of those working outside the agricultural sector, more so than for the wives of those working on farms. Nutritional crises seem to have had a significantly stronger impact on maternal mortality in the period 2\u20136 weeks after childbirth when mothers were most prone to infections and indirect obstetrical causes of maternal death. The findings indicate that both nutritional stress and socio-economic factors contributed to maternal mortality.\n\nKeywords: maternal mortality; historical demography; socio-economic status; economic stress; grain prices; maternal nutritional status\n\nIntroduction\n\nDuring the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, maternal mortality rates in Western countries were generally high, although they did fluctuate significantly. They began a steady and permanent decline in the 1930s when access to maternity care improved substantially and antibiotics became available. The downward trajectory continued, thanks to significant improvements in blood transfusion technology, resuscitation techniques, and anesthesia; the result of medical advances made during the Second World War. In general, the primary causes of maternal mortality\u2014pre-eclampsia, hemorrhage, obstructed labor, infection, and complications from induced abortion\u2014have not been considered to be directly related to nutrition. However, there is evidence that nutrition has a direct impact on maternal outcomes and the relationship between nutrition, socio-economic status, and maternal mortality remains poorly understood for both historical and contemporary populations. Although findings have been inconclusive, research on interventions involving nutritional supplements, carried out in less developed countries, has shown that improving nutritional status may help reduce maternal mortality. A better understanding of the impact of nutritional stress arising from short-term economic crises on maternal mortality in Western countries in the past may shed light on maternal mortality in today's less-developed countries, where conditions sometimes resemble those of the Western world before the demographic transition occurred and where access to modern obstetric care can still be limited.\n\nBackground\n\nThere is very little quantitative data available on the causes of maternal death before the twentieth century because death or burial records seldom contain reliable clinical diagnoses of the cause of death. Historically, two-thirds of maternal deaths in Sweden were directly due to obstetrical causes such as obstructed labor, eclampsia, hemorrhage, and sepsis, while one-third was due to indirect causes such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, dysentery, and heart disease. Contemporary studies on less-developed countries demonstrate that hemorrhage and other obstetric complications occur very soon after delivery, deaths from sepsis and infection are dominant in the following three weeks, and deaths from indirect causes within 29 and 42 days of delivery. Direct obstetric causes of death are frequently tied to the level of maternal care during or after childbirth, whereas indirect causes are more influenced by the overall health of the mother and her nutritional status.\nIn a study of the history of childbirth in the period 1850-1950 in Europe, the USA, Australia, and New Zealand, Loudon (1992a) found that the quality of assistance mothers received during childbirth was one of the main determinants of maternal mortality. More recent historical scholarship has drawn attention to the significance of socio-economic determinants, such as household structure and kinship networks, on maternal mortality in Croatia in the period 1750-1898 (Hammel and Gullickson 2004).\n\nIt has been generally believed that the quality of care pregnant and parturient mothers received was the strongest determinant of maternal mortality in historic populations. Malnutrition and poverty were thought to have played only a limited role because maternal mortality was considered to be impervious to nutritional status (Loudon 2000). Little scholarly attention has therefore been focused on how, before the demographic and health transitions, nutritional stress may have affected maternal mortality. Using a historical data set drawn from six German villages, the aim of the study reported in this paper was to assess the impact of nutritional stress arising from short-term economic crises on maternal mortality. The relationship between women\u2019s nutritional and socio-economic status and their chances of surviving childbirth was re-examined, taking short-term, upward swings in the price of grain as indicators of nutritional stress. The study also examined how the effects of nutritional stress on rates of maternal mortality differed between women from different social strata.\n\nLarge-scale aggregative studies have demonstrated that overall mortality was, in general, sensitive to grain-price fluctuations in most of pre-industrial Europe (Galloway 1988; Lee 1989). However, using such macro-level analyses, historians have been unable to demonstrate that maternal mortality, as measured by the number of \u2018maternal deaths per 1,000, 10,000, or 100,000 births\u2019 (Loudon 1992a), was strongly affected by socio-economic conditions and it is generally accepted that \u2018maternal mortality was remarkably insensitive to social and economic factors\u2019 (Loudon 1992b). Studies conducted at a national level have also failed to find an association between levels of maternal mortality and gross national product (De Brouwere et al. 1998). Comparing trends in maternal mortality rates during the first decades of the nineteenth century in Western countries, Loudon (1992a, b) could not explain the evident differences between the USA, Britain, and the Netherlands by differences in prevailing socio-economic conditions. At the macro level, then, there is little evidence of an association between socio-economic conditions and maternal mortality.\n\nOn the other hand, using a micro-level event-history approach, researchers have successfully demonstrated that, historically, short-term economic crises, which resulted in nutritional crises, did affect infant and adult mortality in the populations of both Western and Far Eastern countries (Campbell et al. 2004). The study reported in this paper used similar micro-level event-history analysis to construct statistical models based on individual-level data from six German villages in the period between 1766 and 1863. These models examined how the nutritional stress engendered by short-term economic crises affected maternal mortality in the 42 days following childbirth. The complete data set for the six villages constructed by John Knodel (1988) was used, and the same price index developed for a previous analysis of reproductive behavior in these villages (Dribe and Scalone 2010) was adopted.\n\nThe next section of the paper provides background information on research on maternal mortality in the past, then briefly outlines the analytical framework before describing the area under study, the data used, and the methods applied. The empirical results are then presented, and a discussion concludes the paper.\nAdvances in immunological research have shown that single or multiple nutritional deficiencies affect the mechanisms of the immune system. Individuals suffering from poor nutritional status generally experience an increase in the frequency and severity of infections, although the scale of the increase depends, in part, on prevailing social and environmental circumstances. Malnutrition could, therefore, further depress the already compromised immune systems of pregnant and parturient women, increasing their risk of mortality at, or shortly after, childbirth.\n\nThe debate about the importance of nutritional status in reducing maternal mortality is an ongoing one. It is still not clear to what extent improvements in nutrition may improve maternal survival, nor what nutritional supplements should be given to whom or when. In addition to the gaps in our understanding of the role nutrition plays in maternal mortality, the paucity of historical data further hampers any attempts to determine the effect of nutrition on maternal mortality in the past.\n\nHistorically, the decline in maternal deaths was attributed solely to improvements in the quality of maternity care and not to improvements in diet. However, other claims suggest that improvements in nutrition, such as increased maternal levels of vitamin A or iron, should not be dismissed as factors possibly contributing to reductions in maternal mortality. The protective effect of vitamin A against puerperal infection was demonstrated in 1931 and further confirmed by a randomized trial of vitamin A supplementation in a Nepalese community. However, a more recent study could not provide evidence to support the role of vitamin A in protecting mothers against infection.\n\nDeficiencies of calcium, vitamin D, or iron in early childhood can negatively affect adult stature, increasing the risk of obstructed labour. Severe malnutrition in childhood often leads to small pelvises in adult women, with a consequently higher risk of obstructed labour leading to maternal death, particularly in communities without easy access to health facilities.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, rickets caused by a lack of vitamin D in childhood was a major cause of obstructed labour. It is thought to have primarily affected women living in polluted, industrial cities, whose uptake of the vitamin was lowered through a lack of exposure to sunshine due to the presence of industrial smog.\n\nThe improved nutritional status of children born in the 1920s helped to lower the risks of obstructed labour when these women began their reproductive life in the 1940s.\n\nIn pre-industrial Europe, annual variations in grain prices were closely tied to the quantity of grain available for consumption and, consequently, to the overall standard of living. A bad harvest would lead to higher grain prices, or a \u2018price shock\u2019, which would, in turn, significantly increase mortality levels. The decrease in rates of survival could continue for several years after the price shock. Various studies have shown that different social groups reacted to the economic stress of a price shock in different ways, with the infant and adult mortality response to increased grain prices varying from one socio-economic group to another.\n\nIt is reasonable to expect, with regard to maternal mortality, that short-term changes in food prices may have had selective effects by socioeconomic status. Predictions suggest that mothers married to farmers would be less vulnerable during times of high prices than mothers whose husbands worked for a daily wage or were not directly involved in agriculture, since the latter groups could not rely on gaining access to supplies of grain stored on farms and their nutrition may have suffered as a consequence.\nEstimates of adult mortality from family reconstitution data can be complicated; however, any potential bias is significantly reduced when calculating estimates of maternal mortality. It is generally assumed that if a woman's date of death was not recorded, she survived the critical period following childbirth (Knodel 1988).\n\nAn Ortssippenbuch includes couples who married locally or in another village and then migrated to the village referenced in the book. Births occurring before a mother\u2019s immigration to one of the study villages were excluded to avoid biasing the results for maternal mortality. Only births taking place within the study villages were included. Including non-local births would bias the rates of maternal mortality downward, as presumably the mother would have survived long enough to move into the local village with the child and would be included in the genealogy (Knodel 1988).\n\nBecause stillbirths have no genealogical relevance, they possibly were under-registered. This under-registration could affect maternal mortality estimates since if a woman died following an unrecorded stillbirth, her death would not have been recorded in the reconstituted family history as following the birth of a child and therefore would not have been classified as a maternal death. \n\nThe data set does provide records of stillbirths, although the proportion they form of all births varies considerably from village to village (Knodel 1988). The stillbirth rate in the six villages was 33 per 1,000 births during the period 1766-1863. This level is within the range estimated for other historical populations in Europe and the official statistics for Germany during the period 1875-1877 (Knodel 1988).\n\nA total of 15,077 childbirth events involving 3,418 mothers occurred in the six study villages between 1766 and 1863, all included in the analysis. Of the 3,418 mothers, 152 died within 42 days after childbirth. This analysis employs models to estimate the effects of socio-economic status and nutritional stress arising from short-term economic crises on the risk of maternal death within 6 weeks, or 42 days, of childbirth. These models include social, economic, and physiological covariates and aim to investigate various influences on maternal mortality. \n\nVariables such as age of mother, parity, occurrence of multiple births, sex of the newborn child, number of previous child deaths, interval since previous birth, and broader factors like crude death rates, area of residence, seasonality, and period were considered. The model also controlled for the effects of several physiological and bio-demographic factors identified in previous research and aimed at understanding the broader socio-economic influences affecting maternal health outcomes in historical populations.\nParity.\nThe number of previous births is an important determinant of maternal mortality (Fedrick and Adelstein 1973; DaVanzo et al. 2004, 2008). Most studies show that the risk of maternal death is high at parity 1 (Andersson et al. 2000), decreases from parity 2 to parity 4, and then rises again (Knodel 1988; Hammel and Gullickson 2005). First births may be associated with an increased risk of obstetric hemorrhage and obstructed labour (Rush 2000). In order to verify the possible existence of the J-shaped relation, 'parity' was designated as a categorical variable, the categories being coded '1', '2-4', '5-7', and '8+' births.\n\nMultiple births.\nThere is empirical evidence from both less developed countries (Conde-Agudelo et al. 2000) and developed countries (Senat et al. 1998) that being pregnant with twins or a higher number of foetuses significantly increases the risk of morbidity and mortality for a mother. Given the strong association between this variable and maternal mortality, our models included a dummy variable for a multiple birth.\n\nSex of newborn child.\nSex differences in length and weight at birth are common (Crawford et al. 1987) and larger, male newborns are expected to be associated with a higher maternal mortality risk. A specific dummy variable for the sex of the child was therefore included in the model.\n\nNumber of previous child deaths.\nThe number of child deaths a mother has suffered reflects her overall health status and her personal, family, and environmental circumstances (DaVanzo et al. 2004, 2008). Evidence from historical studies documents the higher risk of death faced by pregnant women who have experienced the death of a previous child or children (Andersson et al. 2000). A discrete variable, Number of previous child deaths, was included in the set of models relating to mothers who had borne more than one child, to account for the number of child deaths a mother had experienced before her current pregnancy.\n\nInterval since previous birth.\nShort birth intervals negatively impact maternal mortality risks, as found in some historical studies (Hammel and Gullickson 2004, 2005), and a study in Peru among 456,889 women showed that inter-pregnancy intervals of less than 6 months were significantly associated with poorer maternal health and higher mortality (Conde-Agudelo and Beliz\u00e1n 2000). A categorical variable for the length of time from the preceding birth, Interval since previous birth, was calculated with the categories: 'up to 18 months', 'between 19 and 30 months', and 'above 30 months'. Because first births have no preceding birth interval, this covariate was included in a set of models for parities greater than one.\n\nOther variables in the models control for macro-scale influences on the risks of maternal mortality: Crude death rate, Area of residence, Seasonality, and Period.\n\nCrude death rate.\nAnnual crude death rates (CDRs) were estimated for the six study villages to control for community-level mortality levels. The CDRs were calculated by dividing the number of deaths occurring in the villages by the average population in those villages in a given year.\n\nArea of residence.\nProlonged lactation in northern-central Germany and shorter durations in the southern part have differential effects on maternal weight (Kintner 1985; Knodel 1988). A dummy variable in the models, Area of residence, identifies whether a birth occurred in northern or southern villages, serving as a proxy for the type of breastfeeding behaviour a mother is likely to have adopted.\n\nSeasonality.\nSeasonal weather and meteorological conditions affect pregnant and newly delivered women through their influence on seasonal illnesses and access to nutritious food. A four-category variable, Seasonality, was included in the models to control for seasonal variation.\n\nPeriod.\nDevelopments in midwifery may have influenced maternal mortality rates from the eighteenth century onwards. A five-category, temporal variable, Period, was included to assess non-linear period effects. The categories were the periods 1766-74, 1775-99, 1800-24, 1825-49, and 1850-63.\n\nSocio-economic and Rural status affect maternal mortality risks. Socio-economic status was based on a scheme comprising six categories, from higher managers and professionals to those with no occupation. Rural status distinguished between farm and non-farm workers to reveal differential impacts of economic conditions related to agriculture.\n\nA final variable, the fluctuation in rye prices, was included to consider the nutritional crises' impact on maternal health, with different indices calculated for three areas of Germany where the study villages were located. Both current prices and prices lagged by one year were included to assess the effects of economic stress on mortality.\n\nTo assess differential short-term price effects by social class, separate interaction models were estimated. It was expected that farm workers and their wives would be more protected from market fluctuations than other socio-economic groups.\nIn accordance with HISCLASS, two different categorical covariates were coded and used in the models. The first covariate, Socio-economic status, was based on a simplified scheme comprising six categories: (i) higher and lower managers, professionals, clerical, and sales workers; (ii) foremen and skilled workers; (iii) farmers; (iv) lower skilled workers; (v) unskilled workers; and (vi) those with no occupation, including those cases where an occupation could not be classified or was unknown.\n\nThis covariate was developed to distinguish those working in agriculture from other workers. Farmers, lower skilled, and unskilled farm workers were aggregated into a single category, 'farm workers', while another single category 'non-farm workers' was used to group lower skilled and unskilled workers in other activities, skilled workers, foremen, managers, professionals, clerical, and sales workers. The distinction between the two groups helped to reveal the differential impact of price changes on the wives of farm workers and the wives of men not directly involved in agriculture. It was expected that the farm workers, and their wives, would be better protected against the risks of ill-health and mortality following a bad harvest and during times of higher grain prices, since they would have greater access to food stored on the farms.\n\nA measure of fluctuations in rye prices was included in the models as a final variable. Rye was the grain most commonly used to make bread in Germany during the study period, whereas wheat was mainly consumed by the upper classes as a luxury food. Rye was a basic component of pre-industrial diets and German laborers spent a significant proportion of their wages buying it. Rye cultivation represented a substantial share of German agricultural production.\n\nTo consider the impact of periodic crises in nutrition on the health status of parturient mothers, a price index for rye was constructed using a method similar to that used in a previous analysis of data from the same sample of villages. The effect of short-term fluctuations in prices was then measured by their deviation from a medium-term trend. The index deviation was calculated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter with a smoothing parameter of 6.25. This filter was preferable for considering deviations from what could be considered 'normal' years.\n\nTo represent each of the three areas of Germany where the study villages were located, three different indices were calculated by incorporating rye prices from nearby markets. Both current prices, 'Rye price (t)', and prices lagged by 1 year, 'Rye price (t-1)', were included in the model, since it was expected that short-term economic stress would not only affect mortality immediately but also one or more years later.\n\nThe calculated residuals were divided by 10, hence the coefficients in the estimated models should be interpreted as the effect on maternal mortality risk of a ten-unit deviation in the rye price index from the normal level.\n\nSeparate interaction models were estimated to assess differential short-term price effects by social class. It was expected that farmers, as grain producers, and their wives would be shown to have been more protected from market fluctuations than those in other socio-economic categories. Conversely, laborers who needed to purchase grain were expected to have been more adversely affected by high prices than higher status groups, who would have had access to greater resources.\n\nThe results for two different models were as follows: Model 1, a basic model including only socio-economic status and prices; and Model 2, a full model including all the control covariates drawn from both the biodemographic and macro-level variables.\n\nModel 1 shows that the wives of unskilled workers and men without a recognized occupation register a higher risk of maternal death than the wives of farmers, who form the reference category. It is interesting to note that the risk by socio-economic group is U-shaped: the risks are highest for the wives of lower skilled and unskilled workers, decrease amongst the wives of skilled workers and farmers, and then rise again amongst the wives of managers, professionals, and men in clerical and sales occupations.\n\nAccording to Model 1, the relative risk increases significantly 1 year after a price rise. The full model, Model 2, indicates that biodemographic effects on maternal mortality were stronger than socio-economic determinants in both their magnitude and significance. Multiple births were extremely dangerous, with 3 times the risk of death for the mother relative to a single birth; a result which was statistically highly significant.\n\nThe timing of socio-economic and price effects on women\u2019s risk of maternal mortality can be observed from hazard estimates. The hazard reaches its peak in the week after a woman has given birth, during which maternal deaths are primarily attributable to direct obstetric causes such as hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, embolism, and puerperal infections.\nThe wives of farmers, who form the reference category, are central to understanding how socio-economic groups correlate with risk, exhibiting a U-shaped risk curve: highest for the wives of lower skilled and unskilled workers, decreasing amongst the wives of skilled workers and farmers, and rising again amongst the wives of managers, professionals, and men in clerical and sales occupations. \n\nThe effects of short-term nutritional crises are also noteworthy, with significant relative risk increases seen 1 year after a price rise. The full model, Model 2, demonstrates that bio-demographic effects on maternal mortality were stronger than socio-economic determinants in both their magnitude and significance. Multiple births were extremely dangerous, leading to triple the risk of death for the mother relative to a single birth; this result was statistically highly significant. The maternal mortality risk was highest for parity 1 births, being twice that for parity 2-4 births. There is a J-shaped effect for maternal age, with the relative risk for mothers aged less than 20 years being 1.8 times that of women aged 20-24, decreasing to just 0.6 for ages 25-29, and then rising significantly to 2.3 for women aged over 40.\n\nThe variable controlling for crude death rate (CDR) registers a significant positive effect. Seasonality showed no significant effect, although lower risks of maternal mortality were observed in summer than in spring. Over time, the model evidences a decline in maternal mortality at the end of the eighteenth century, with subsequent periods reflecting increasing risks of dying from childbirth, though these increases are not statistically significant. Random effects reveal that the shared frailty of mothers within sibling clusters explains a limited proportion of the total variance.\n\nObservations about the timing of socio-economic and price effects on women\u2019s risk of maternal mortality show that socio-economic differences are most pronounced on the day of delivery; wives of unskilled workers and those with non-occupational husbands are at quantifiably higher risks. More than 2 weeks post-delivery (15-42 days), no socio-economic effects are found, but the lagged price effect shows a significant 18 percent increase in risk.\n\nThe regression analysis revealed that non-farm workers' wives experience a 31 percent higher risk of maternal mortality following a price rise compared to their agricultural counterparts. This data suggest that economic crises impact maternal mortality rates more significantly among non-agricultural families.\nNon-farm workers register a significantly higher risk of maternal mortality amongst their wives than do their agricultural counterparts. In fact, in the year following a rise in prices, their risk of maternal mortality is 31 percent higher than that of farmers and farm workers. These results indicate that following an economic crisis, maternal mortality varies significantly between the wives of men employed in agriculture and the wives of men who are not.\n\nA specific set of models was designed to take into account the expectation that the risk of dying varied at different parities. Logistic regression analysis of the risk of a mother dying within 42 days of delivery showed the interaction between Rural status and Rye price in six German villages from 1766 to 1863. Results from various models indicated interactions between rural status and changes in rye prices at different times before or after grain harvests influencing maternal risk. Parameters such as age of mother, parity, multiple births, sex of the newborn child, crude death rate, seasonality, and period were also controlled in these models.\n\nAdditional models controlled for the number of previous child deaths, as well as for maternal depletion covariates such as interval since previous birth and area of residence, which acted as a proxy for breastfeeding practices. Amongst women in the \u2018Parity 2-4\u2019 category, the risk of maternal mortality was much reduced in the two longer categories of interval since previous birth, those who had a previous birth interval of \u201819-30 months\u2019 or \u2018more than 30 months\u2019, compared to those whose previous birth interval was \u2018less than 18 months\u2019.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe study assessed the determinants of maternal mortality in a sample of pre-demographic transition German villages. The findings indicate that rural farm workers experienced lower maternal mortality than other socio-economic groups when a poor harvest caused grain prices to rise, reducing the amount of grain available for consumption. The subsequent nutritional stress and the implications for the health of the population appear to have been most keenly experienced by workers not directly employed in agriculture. These findings lend support to those advocating for the provision of nutritional supplements to pregnant women in less developed countries and suggest that such programs should target urban dwellers in particular.\n\nSome bio-demographic variables were strongly associated with maternal death. The risk was highest amongst those experiencing their first birth and decreased for women at parities 2, 3, or 4. It increased significantly at higher parities and ages, indicating that childbirth posed a greater risk for older mothers. Signs of maternal depletion were supported by the lower relative risk found for longer categories of interval since the previous birth for those at parities between 2 and 4. However, at \u2018Parity 5 and above,\u2019 the relative risk for previous-birth-interval categories was not significant and in an unexpected direction.\n\nThe effect of short-term increases in rye prices on maternal mortality became evident a year after the prices rose, indicating a delayed response consistent with previous findings on the impact of economic crises on health in pre-industrial Europe. Further research is needed to replicate these findings in different historical populations.\nThe sample was not fully representative of that area. East Friesland in northern Germany, where breastfeeding was \u2018fairly prolonged\u2019 (Knodel 1988, p. 542), generally presents higher maternal mortality rates. However, this is not the case for Middels, which is situated in East Friesland but registered lower mortality rates. As Knodel observed, the lower rate of Middels is not \u2018typical for East Friesland\u2019 and it could be due to some \u2018statistical fluctuations\u2019 or some under-reporting of mortality which has affected the estimates. It is also possible that breastfeeding protected mothers by lengthening birth intervals and consequently decreasing maternal depletion. A recent study on early twentieth-century Germany found that breastfeeding practices positively affected the height of men in the military (Haines and Kintner 2008). It is theoretically possible, therefore, that women who were breastfed in their infancy may also have been taller and, as a consequence, less exposed to the risk of obstructed labour.\n\nThe effect of a short-term increase in rye prices emerges a year after the prices rose and has a greater and more significant impact on the risk of a maternal death occurring between 15 and 42 days after delivery. This delayed response is consistent with previous findings on the response of mortality to short-term crises in pre-industrial Europe. As several studies on overall mortality have shown, the effect of grain-price rises was often delayed because it took time for nutritional deprivation to affect human health severely. The majority of deaths were not a direct consequence of starvation but were due mainly to the populations\u2019 weakened immune systems, which meant that they were unable to ward off infectious diseases. Since infections were one of the main causes of maternal deaths in the later neo-natal period, this explanation could be extended to maternal mortality, given that severe nutritional stress could have further reduced mothers\u2019 immunity to infection significantly.\n\nThe significant effect of the lagged rye price variable on multiparous women is consistent with this explanation since the mothers\u2019 immunity could have been lowered by the combined effects of malnutrition and maternal depletion; nutritional stress would have had much more severe consequences for a mother whose body was already depleted through repeated childbirth and whose immune system was not working effectively.\n\nWe also assessed the differential impact of economic crises on those who worked on farms and those who did not. As expected, farmers and farm workers did not experience an increase in maternal mortality risk after a rise in rye prices, presumably because a bad harvest did not necessarily lead to worsening living standards for those working in agriculture. Previous historical studies of pre-industrial Europe have shown that poor harvests often led to higher grain prices, which benefited those producing grain. Farm workers in farming areas appear to have benefited from the same risk-reducing factors as farmers during bad economic times.\n\nBad harvests and high grain prices forced urban workers, as grain consumers, to spend a higher proportion of their income on this essential foodstuff, leading to a fall in the demand for other products and services. As a result, urban markets and trade would have stagnated, depressing wages and salaries further. Because skilled workers such as shoemakers and tailors, and their assistants, suffered a decline in the demand for their products, they would have been particularly vulnerable to food shortages during periods of high grain prices.\n\nBeing the wife of a farmer appears to have offered a better chance of survival for parturient women. One explanation for this could lie in the type of maternal assistance available during childbirth. In the first, controversial phases of the medicalization of childbirth, rural midwives often provided less lethal assistance than urban male physicians. Studies in less developed countries and in historical populations have shown clearly that expert midwives could reduce risks of maternal death. Physiological explanations for better maternal survival in farming areas are also possible. In the pre-industrial era, self-sufficient farms were the source of nutritious food, which gave farmers\u2019 wives a higher level of physiological capital. This could, in turn, have offered them sufficient protection from maternal depletion and the other risks of pregnancy to make a difference to their survival chances during famine and bad economic times. In addition, better nutritional status over a lifetime could also have improved height and stature in adulthood, and reduced the risks of obstructed labor amongst better-fed women.\nDe Brouwere, Vincent, Ren\u00e9 Tonglet, and Wim Van Lerberghe. 1998.

In the absence of ethnic information on birth records, we developed indirect estimation methods that use a combination of vital statistics, the census (both microdata and aggregate tables), and survey data (Labour Force Survey). We estimated age-specific and total fertility rates successively for five broad ethnic groups encompassed by all data-sets, and for eight ethnic groups encompassed by the 1991 and 2001 Censuses for England. We then used census data to disaggregate the estimates to the 16 ethnic groups required for the subnational projections and the Hadwiger function to estimate single-year-of-age estimates. We estimated the uncertainty around the fertility estimates and used a logistic model to project rates to 2021, after which we assumed rates would remain constant.\n\nKeywords: ethnic fertility; birth statistics; subnational estimates; ethnic projections; plausibility ranges\n\nIntroduction\nThe role of ethnicity in subnational population projections\n\nIn censuses and surveys, variables that can inform on ethnic background include the following: country of birth or family origin, country of citizenship or nationality, race, language, and religion. There is a need to incorporate such information in demographic work for two broad reasons. The first is that such data are needed for planning purposes. Data on age and sex for members of ethnic subgroups are needed by local governments and other agencies in order to produce population estimates and projections for subnational areas. Knowledge of ethnic-group numbers by age and locality can help in estimating demand for particular goods and services such as language support, design of housing, and food choices. If we can estimate recent trends and project future populations for ethnic groups, then debates about diversity and immigration levels can be better informed. The second reason is that establishing the heterogeneity of population subgroups improves the quality of aggregate data. If different groups of people have distinct age-sex structures and demographic propensities, which is the case for different ethnic groups, details of these differences will lead to improved information about the population.\n\nMethods for projecting ethnic populations\n\nA range of methods exist for projecting populations, the most common of which is the cohort-component method. In this method, age-specific fertility, mortality, and migration rates are applied to an area\u2019s base population to project the population in the future. Rees outlines the cohort-component method used for the official UK-wide national projections and shows how it can be extended to ethnic groups. For subnational projections, there is a need for robust estimates of ethnic-group fertility, mortality, and migration rates for local areas. In the UK, statistics on ethnic groups have been available from national surveys since the late 1970s and from the 1991 and 2001 Censuses. However, for population projections, the inclusion of age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) by ethnic group poses a problem because ethnicity is not recorded when births are registered.\n\nIn a number of countries, population projections are made for the different ethnic/racial groups that comprise the national population. For example, the US Census Bureau makes projections by race and Statistics New Zealand differentiates between groups which are European or Other, M\u0101ori, Asian, or Pacific in origin. For Australia, projections include regional populations by Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) and non-Indigenous status underpinned by census and vital events data. The practices of different European countries are reviewed by Coleman. Ethnicity is defined by citizenship or country of birth, which means that the offspring of foreign-born individuals are usually treated as indigenous for projection purposes after one or two generations.\n\nClassifications of ethnicity in the UK are based on self-reporting for census or social survey questionnaires. The categories used are a compromise between the need to keep the question simple and the requirements of pressure groups, academics, and government practitioners for the ethnic detail needed for research and the formulation of policy. In the UK Census, ethnic-group classifications are based on two concepts: race and country of origin. To date, most estimates and projections use aggregated groups, which do not reveal the different demographic dynamics that might exist within subgroups. The 2001 Census revealed these groups to have relatively young age structures and potential for population growth, and thus demonstrated the limitations of mixed-group analyses.\n\nFertility variation by ethnic group and geographical area\n\nEvidence has emerged that, cross-sectionally by age or in completed family size, fertility rates vary between ethnic groups in the UK. Compared with a white (largely British) reference group, women in ethnic groups originating from South Asian countries tend to have relatively high fertility. Among the South Asians, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups have higher fertility than the Indian group, whose fertility rates are gradually converging on the national level. The Chinese group has relatively low fertility. A more varied picture has emerged for Black African and Black Caribbean women. Boyle has shown that the geography of fertility matters, and Boyle et al. and Tromans et al. have revealed cross-sectional and time-series patterns. Since there are distinct geographical distributions of ethnic groups, we expected to find that variations in fertility by ethnic group would vary spatially.\n\nA model for projecting ethnic-group populations for subnational areas in England\n\nThis paper reports on a method of estimating ASFRs by ethnic group for use in a projection model for local areas in England. The model provides population counts by age (0-100 and over) and sex. The projections start in 2001 and extend to 2051 in annual steps using England\u2019s 352 local authorities (2001 Census boundary definitions). For the fertility component, the projection uses ASFRs applied to the population of women of childbearing age to yield total fertility rates (TFRs). We describe the methods used to estimate fertility at LA level in England for the 16 ethnic groups used in the 2001 Census. The method has also been applied using the ASFRs of ethnic groups in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, but only at national level.\n\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. First, we report on the data sources, and then how we estimated fertility rates by ethnic group and 5-year age groups at both national and LA level. We go on to report on how we estimated single-year-of-age fertility rates from the 5-year grouped information. Since children can have a mother and a father of different ethnicities, we describe a method for estimating the ethnicity of the newborn. We quantify plausibility ranges of our estimates before going on to use past trends in ethnic fertility to inform our assumptions about future levels, which are entered into our projections. Finally, we summarize and reflect on the method of producing the estimates of ethnic fertility for subnational areas in England and consider some possible enhancements for future work.\nRates (ASFRs) by ethnic group poses a problem because ethnicity is not recorded when births are registered (Dubuc 2009; Williamson and Norman 2011). In a number of countries, population projections are made for the different ethnic/racial groups that comprise the national population. The US Census Bureau (2008) makes projections by race and Statistics New Zealand (2008) differentiates between groups which are European or Other, M\u0101ori, Asian, or Pacific in origin. For Australia, Wilson (2009) projects regional populations by Indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) and non-Indigenous status underpinned by census and vital events data. The practices of different European countries are reviewed by Coleman (2006). Ethnicity is defined by citizenship or country of birth, which means that the offspring of foreign-born individuals are usually treated as indigenous for projection purposes after one or two generations.\n\nClassifications of ethnicity in the UK are based on self-reporting for census or social survey questionnaires (ONS 2003). The categories used are a compromise between the need to keep the question simple and the requirements of pressure groups, academics, and government practitioners for the ethnic detail needed for research and the formulation of policy. In the UK Census, ethnic-group classifications are based on two concepts: race and country of origin. To date, most estimates and projections (e.g., Rees and Butt 2004; Coleman and Scherbov 2005; Coleman 2006; Rees and Parsons 2006) use aggregated groups, which do not reveal the different demographic dynamics that might exist within subgroups. The 2001 Census revealed these groups to have relatively young age structures and potential for population growth, and thus demonstrated the limitations of mixed-group analyses.\n\nFertility variation by ethnic group and geographical area\n\nEvidence has emerged that, cross-sectionally by age or in completed family size, fertility rates vary between ethnic groups in the UK (Thompson 1982; Coleman and Salt 1992; Rees and Phillips 1996; Simpson 1997; Sporton and White 2002; Robson and Berthoud 2006; Dubuc 2009; Coleman and Dubuc 2010; Dubuc and Haskey 2010). Compared with a white (largely British) reference group, women in ethnic groups originating from South Asian countries tend to have relatively high fertility. Among the South Asians, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups have higher fertility than the Indian group, whose fertility rates are gradually converging on the national level. The Chinese group has relatively low fertility. A more varied picture has emerged for Black African and Black Caribbean women. Boyle (2003) has shown that the geography of fertility matters, and Boyle et al. (2007) and Tromans et al. (2008) have revealed cross-sectional and time-series patterns. Since there are distinct geographical distributions of ethnic groups (Rees and Butt 2004; Finney and Simpson 2009), we expected to find that variations in fertility by ethnic group would vary spatially.\n\nA model for projecting ethnic-group populations for subnational areas in England\n\nThis paper reports on a method of estimating ASFRs by ethnic group for use in a projection model for local areas in England. The model provides population counts by age (0 to 100 and over) and sex (Rees et al. 2011). The projections start in 2001 and extend to 2051 in annual steps using England\u2019s 352 local authorities (2001 Census boundary definitions). For the fertility component, the projection uses ASFRs applied to the population of women of childbearing age to yield total fertility rates (TFRs). We describe the methods used to estimate fertility at LA level in England for the 16 ethnic groups used in the 2001 Census. The method has also been applied using the ASFRs of ethnic groups in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, but only at national level.\n\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. First, we report on the data sources, and then how we estimated fertility rates by ethnic group and 5-year age groups at both national and LA level. We go on to report on how we estimated single-year-of-age fertility rates from the 5-year grouped information. Since children can have a mother and a father of different ethnicities, we describe a method for estimating the ethnicity of the newborn. We quantify plausibility ranges of our estimates before going on to use past trends in ethnic fertility to inform our assumptions about future levels, which are entered into our projections. Finally, we summarize and reflect on the method of producing the estimates of ethnic fertility for subnational areas in England and consider some possible enhancements for future work.\n\nPaul Norman et al.\nEstimating fertility by ethnic group for England involves using a combination of sources and methods to calculate fertility rates at the national level. Methods include ratio and apportionment methods, where relationships between indicators are used to scale and distribute rates and counts, and constraints, where data from one source are controlled to sum to another, presumably more reliable, source.\n\nThe procedure begins with calculating Age-Specific Fertility Rates (ASFRs) and Total Fertility Rates (TFRs) for all women in a census year. The overall levels of fertility for eight ethnic groups were then estimated, using the Sample of Anonymised Records (SARs), followed by using information from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) to estimate differences in the age profile of fertility by ethnic group. A table from the 2001 Census was used to disaggregate the fertility rates by broad ethnic group into more selective ethnic groups. All estimates were controlled to ensure that the number of births across ethnic groups matched the national total of births by each 5-year age group.\n\nFor England specifically, ASFRs were calculated for 2001 using the counts of births by age of woman as numerators and the mid-year estimates as denominators. Births to women aged less than 20 and those aged over 40 were grouped together for rate calculations. The TFR calculated from these ASFRs was 1.63 children per woman.\n\nEthnic-specific fertility levels were estimated since birth registrations are not classified by ethnic group. Child-Woman Ratios (CWRs) were used to represent family size; these are defined by the ratio of children within a desired age range to women at risk over the fertile age groups. Using the SAR, a study population for England was created with recoded ethnic-group information. A national-level CWR linking women by ethnic group to the presence of a dependent child was computed, and this ratio was applied to the TFR for all women.\n\nData from the LFS was obtained for each year from the 1980s, harmonized to identify consistent ethnic groups over time. This information was used to calculate national age-specific rates by 5-year age group of woman and ethnic group for 2001. Combining this data with vital statistics, census, and survey estimates allowed for comprehensive estimates of ASFRs by the eight ethnic groups common to the 1991 and 2001 Censuses.\n\nThis combined approach ensures that the estimation process is thorough and incorporates multiple datasets to provide a reliable measure of fertility by ethnic group in England.\nCombining the vital statistics, census, and survey fertility estimates for England, we combined the information from each separate source to make estimates of ASFRs by the eight ethnic groups common to the 1991 and 2001 Censuses. The method, described below, is shown as a set of six steps with their associated equations.\n\nIn Step 1, initial ASFRs are estimated by scaling the rates by age for each ethnic group by the vital-statistics-based all-women ASFRs and LFS-based all-women rates by age. The LFS-derived rates for the broader ethnic groups were applied to the ASFRs for more selective ethnic groups in equation (6). The rates for the combined Pakistani and Bangladeshi group were used for both of the separate groups. TFRs were calculated from these initial ASFRs by summation (equation (7)). \n\nIn Step 2, the ASFRs from Step 1 were scaled to agree with the SAR-derived TFRs for each ethnic group in equation (8). In Step 3, the births by each ethnic group and age group of mother were calculated using equation (9).\n\nIn Step 4, the first estimates of births by ethnic group and age were scaled to sum to the vital statistics total for all women, using equation (10). In Step 5, the ASFRs by ethnic group were recalculated, using the births from Step 4, employing equation (11). In Step 6, Steps 2\u20135 were iterated until the fit of the data-sets no longer improved.\n\nDisaggregating the age-specific fertility rates for England to the 16 ethnic groups of the 2001 Census, the White group and Other group common to the 1991 and 2001 Censuses required further disaggregation into three and seven more selective 2001 Census groups, respectively. A difficulty in relying on dataset is that the data may suffer from numerator and denominator bias if infants and mothers are missed in the census, fertility rates will be affected.\n\nEstimates of total fertility rates by broad ethnic group based on the Sample of Anonymised Records, England 2001, show differences amongst groups. For instance, the TFR for the White group was 1.62, Black Caribbean 1.56, Black African 1.60, Indian 1.82, Pakistani 2.06, Bangladeshi 2.20, Chinese 1.26, and Other 1.48, indicating variations in fertility rates across different ethnic groups.\n\nThis adjusted method for breaking down national-level information in conjunction with local-area data allows more precise estimation of fertility rates by ethnic group across different regions.\nOthers and the broader White group to which they belonged and equivalently for the groups belonging to the Other category. This presumes that any census non-response is the same for the more selective groups as a subset of the larger group.\n\nIn Step 1, a TFR for the more selective group was calculated as the TFR for the broad group previously calculated, scaled by the ratio between the TFR for the more selective group and the broad group as evidenced by CO534. In Step 2, the ASFRs for the broad ethnic groups calculated previously were scaled by the ratio between the ASFRs for the more selective groups and the broad group as determined from CO534. TFRs were calculated as sums of the ASFR estimates. In Step 3, the ASFRs derived from Step 2 were scaled by the ratio between the TFRs for the more selective groups calculated in Step 1 and the TFRs derived from Step 2. In Step 4, the number of births for each ethnic group was calculated, using the mid-year estimate of women as the population at risk. In Step 5, the first estimate of births by ethnic group and age was scaled to sum to the total for the previous estimate of births for the broad group. In Step 6, the ASFRs for the more selective ethnic groups were recalculated using the births from Step 5. Finally, Steps 3-6 were iterated until the fit of the datasets no longer improved. The ASFRs for the groups which comprised the White and Other groups are illustrated in Figures 4(a) and (b).\n\nThe results of the estimations reported above are sets of 5-year ASFRs for eight ethnic groups for 1991 and 2001 and for 16 ethnic groups for England in 2001. Next, we describe how this national-level information was combined with LA-level data to estimate 5-year ASFRs by ethnic group for local areas.\n\nEstimating fertility by ethnic group at the local level, the England-level fertility rates are combined with local-level information to estimate 5-year ASFRs for each LA in England. Since they have small populations, data for the City of London and the Isles of Scilly have been combined with the City of Westminster and Penwith, respectively. The procedure adopted for each LA was as follows: First, ASFRs and TFRs for all women in 2001 were calculated from vital statistics and mid-year populations. Next, overall levels of fertility by the eight ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 were estimated from local CWRs, adjusted using information from the SARs and the national-level ASFR estimates by the broad ethnic group to scale the local age profiles of fertility. Finally, for the 2001 rates, we re-allocated the information for the eight ethnic groups to the 16 groups used in the 2001 Census outputs. As they had been at the national level, these LA estimates of rates by ethnic group were controlled to make the number of births across ethnic groups sum to the local total of births by 5-year age groups. All the ASFRs were calculated for 5-year age groups. The subsequent estimation of single-year-of-age rates will be described later.\n\nFertility rates for local areas for all women were calculated using counts of births by age of the woman from the vital statistics as numerators and mid-year estimates as denominators. As with the national rates, births to women aged less than 20 were grouped together and divided by the total number of women aged 15-19. Births to women aged 40 and over were divided by the total number of women aged 40-44.\nOverall levels of fertility by the eight ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 were estimated from local Child-Woman Ratios (CWRs), adjusted using information from the SARs and the national-level Age-Specific Fertility Rate (ASFR) estimates by broad ethnic group to scale the local age profiles of fertility. Finally, for the 2001 rates, we re-allocated the information for the eight ethnic groups to the 16 groups used in the 2001 Census outputs. As they had been at national level, these Local Authority (LA) estimates of rates by ethnic group were controlled to make the number of births across ethnic groups sum to the local total of births by 5-year age groups. All the ASFRs were calculated for 5-year age groups. The subsequent estimation of single-year-of-age rates will be described later.\n\nFertility rates for local areas for all women were calculated using ASFRs and Total Fertility Rates (TFRs) for all women using counts of births by age of woman from the vital statistics as numerators and mid-year estimates as denominators. As with the national rates, births to women aged less than 20 were grouped together and divided by the total number of women aged 15-19. Births to women aged 40 and over were divided by the total number of women aged 40-44. The ASFRs in 2001 for Bradford, West Yorkshire alongside the national curve show that this LA has a younger fertility profile than that shown for England as a whole and a TFR of 2.17. For 2001 in England, only Blackburn (2.19) and Newham (2.20) had higher TFRs than Bradford. The lowest TFRs were in the cities of Durham (1.14) and Cambridge (1.20).\n\nChild-Woman Ratios (CWRs) can be used to proxy family size by ethnic group. We used total counts of children aged 0-4 and women aged 15-44 from the mid-year estimates by ethnic group in CWRs to indicate local variations in family size. For the eight ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 and for each LA in England, the TFR for all women in 2001 was scaled by each ethnic group's CWR divided by the CWR for all women.\n\nA drawback of this procedure is that the fertility of the White group tends to be under-estimated and the fertility of non-White groups to be over-estimated. This discrepancy arises because if a child was reported at the 2001 Census as being of 'Mixed' ethnicity, this may have been because the mother was 'White' and the father 'Black'. However, when calculating the CWRs, the children of 'Other' ethnicity (into which the Mixed would be allocated) were linked only with Other group mothers, deflating the White CWR and inflating the Other CWR. Correction factors were needed to address this issue.\n\nAs noted previously, the individual-level data in the SARs give a realistic national-level CWR by directly linking women by ethnic group to the number of children they have had, and thus can be used to estimate ethnic-group-specific TFRs. The national CWR-based SARs and the area CWRs were used to provide ethnic-specific scaling factors through which the LA CWRs could be adjusted. The calculation proceeded as follows for each LA: TFRi e8 = TFRi + (CWRSAR e8 /CWR+ e8) * (CWRi e8/CWRi +)\n\nThe CWRs for the eight ethnic groups in each LA, scaled as above, were used to scale the TFR for all women to give an estimated TFR for each ethnic group. To avoid small-number exaggerations, where numbers of children or women fell below a threshold (100 persons), the CWR was calculated as the average of the national CWR for the ethnic group and the local all-women CWR.\nSingle year of age, by modelling age-specific fertility curves as mathematical functions (McNeil et al. 1977; Hoem et al. 1981; Chandola et al. 1999; Schmertmann 2003; Peristera and Kostaki 2007). These methods often include the fitting of splines and the application of the Hadwiger function (Hadwiger 1940), which was used for smoothing ASFRs in London boroughs (Hay and Hollis 2005). We used the Hadwiger function to compute robust estimates of fertility rates by single year of age. Details are given in Norman et al. (2011) and Williamson and Norman (2011). The ASFRs by single year of age and ethnic group for 2001 at both England level and LA level comprised the inputs to the projection model. All the rates described above are period-age fertility rates and these were converted to the period-cohort rates required in the projection model by averaging rates for successive years.\n\nEstimating mixed ethnicity births and applying a sex ratio Since women may have partners of a different ethnicity from their own (Simpson 2002a; Sporton and White 2002), when the projection was run we included a step for generating the ethnicity of the newborn (Wilson 2009; Coleman 2010). We used Commissioned Table CO431 from the 2001 Census to estimate mixing probabilities, which cross-classify children under one in households by the ethnicity of their mother and the ethnicity assigned by their parent(s) on the census return.\n\nIn the projection model, after the ASFRs had been applied to the population at risk to estimate the births by ethnic group, a mixing matrix was applied to the births. The matrix contained the probabilities of the child\u2019s ethnicity conditional on the mother\u2019s ethnicity. Thus, transfers from one ethnic group to another could result. The main factors underpinning these transfers were partnerships between men and women of different ethnicities and decisions by parents about the ethnicity assigned to their offspring on the census form. Parents and children may also have had different ethnicities when children were adopted.\n\nEstimating plausibility ranges for fertility rates and birth counts We have described the ASFRs and TFRs as estimates and should therefore reflect on their reliability. The aim was to use each data source for the advantage it had and to use triangulation and control to lessen the impact of potential error (Simpson 1998). Thus, it was essential that the counts of births, which resulted from the application of estimated ASFRs by ethnic group, returned the same counts of births by each 5-year age group at both England level and LA level as recorded in the vital registration system. The LFS sample was used to reveal differences in the shape of the fertility curve. It was necessary to compromise between pooling years of data to achieve a sample size large enough to estimate differences between a detailed set of ethnic groups (but losing possible variations across years) and pooling fewer years but only for broad ethnic groups. We pooled three years of LFS samples with child age centred on census year, but we did not differentiate between the estimated ASFRs for Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups or the Black African and Black Caribbean groups although in fact there are differences.\n\nConsistency of ethnic group of mother and child: probabilities (per cents) of ethnic group of child under 1 by ethnic group of mother, 2001 Census, England\n\n| Ethnic Group of Mother  | White | Mixed | Asian | Black | Chinese or Other Group | Total |\n|--------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------------------------|-------|\n| White British (WBR)     | 83.4  | 96.8  | 64.3  | 49.7  | 21.0                   | 100.0 |\n| Irish (WIR)              | 0.4   | 0.1   | 25.4  | 0.3   | 0.0                    | 100.0 |\n| Other White (WHO)        | 2.2   | 0.4   | 4.4   | 40.1  | 2.2                    | 100.0 |\n| Mixed White & Black Caribbean (WBC) | 1.5 | 1.1 | 1.7 | 1.5 | 48.1              | 100.0 |\n| Mixed White & Black African (WBA)   | 0.5 | 0.3 | 0.7 | 1.6 | 2.0                | 100.0 |\n| Mixed White & Asian (WAS)           | 1.2 | 0.6 | 1.5 | 2.3 | 0.9                | 100.0 |\n| Other Mixed (OMI)                    | 0.9 | 0.3 | 0.9 | 2.2 | 12.1              | 100.0 |\n| Asian Indian (IND)                   | 2.1 | 0.0 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.5               | 100.0 |\n| Pakistani (PAK)                      | 2.4 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.5               | 100.0 |\n| Bangladeshi (BAN)                    | 0.9 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 0.1               | 100.0 |\n| Other Asian (OAS)                    | 0.6 | 0.0 | 0.1 | 0.4 | 0.4               | 100.0 |\n| Black Caribbean (BLC)                | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 0.1 | 8.8               | 100.0 |\n| Black African (BLA)                  | 1.7 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 0.6 | 0.7               | 100.0 |\n| Other Black (OBL)                    | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 2.6               | 100.0 |\n| Chinese (CHI)                        | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.0               | 100.0 |\n| Other Ethnic Group (OTH)             | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.2               | 100.0 |\n\nKey to per cent classes: 80 per cent, 50 B80 per cent, 25 B50 per cent, 1 B25 per cent, B1 per cent\n\nNotes: Percentages sum to 100% (Children under 1 by child\u2019s and mother\u2019s ethnic group/Mothers by mother\u2019s ethnic group).\nSource: 2001 Census Commissioned Table CO431.\nExtracting from the outputs of re-running the models, Table 12 shows equivalent data for Bradford, West Yorkshire as an example. The estimated TFRs are listed along with the plausibility range for the different TFRs which resulted from the concurrent application of 95 per cent lower and upper CIs derived from each of the different data sources at national level and of 95 per cent CIs for CWRs at LA level. As at national level, the estimated births in 2001 were constrained to sum to the vital registration totals by age, as had each version with the application of upper and lower CIs. The birth counts tabulated in the plausibility range are the minimum and maximum values which result for each ethnic group. There is variation in the TFRs for groups, but the extent to which this leads to different numbers of births depends on the size of the populations. For example, both the Black African and Chinese groups have quite wide variation in the TFRs shown (the LA CWRs have wide CIs because the populations are relatively small for these groups in Bradford) but the variation in the number of births is plus or minus less than one birth for each group. The plausibility range is therefore narrow.\n\nEstablishing assumptions about future age-specific fertility rates Essential to a population projection are plausible and justifiable assumptions about future levels of each demographic component. We used England-level annual time trends in fertility by age and ethnic group from 1991 to 2009 to inform assumptions about the direction of future fertility at LA level. Although the timeframe of the projection model runs to 2051, we restricted our predictions to the year 2021, using constant rates thereafter.\n\nAs inputs to establish past trends we used 5-year age-group information from the following sources: (i) an annual time series of ASFRs for England (updating Tromans et al. 2008); (ii) an annual time series of age-specific rates of the presence of a dependent child (LFS); and (iii) our estimates of ASFRs for 1991 and 2001 for the ethnic groups used for both these census years.\n\nFirst, the 5-year ASFR estimates by ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 were scaled by growth (decline) rates in each age group as indicated by the change from one year to the next from 1991 to 2009 in the national all-women rates.\n\nSecond, the 5-year ASFR estimates by ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 were scaled by growth (decline) rates in each age group as indicated by the change from one year to the next in the rates for each broad ethnic group, using the LFS from 1991 to 2009.\n\nThird, an annual time series of 5-year rates by ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 was obtained by averaging the results of equations.\n\nConclusions For policy-related and practical applications, there is a need for age-sex population counts and projections by ethnic group and subnational area. We have developed a new population projection model that generates details for 16 ethnic groups by age, sex, and LA areas in England. A model of this nature requires inputs of ethnic-specific demographic rates of fertility, mortality, and migration. We have given details of the estimation of ASFRs. The estimation of the other components are discussed elsewhere. Rees et al. provide a summary of the input estimations, a definition of the projection model, and an analysis of specimen projections.\nWhere \\(p_{t+1,x}\\) is the national rate at which women aged \\(x\\) at time \\(t+1\\) had a child aged 0-4 and \\(p_{t+1,x}\\) is the equivalent rate for time \\(t\\). The changes for the larger groups in the LFS were applied to the 1991 and 2001 common groups they contained.\n\nThird, an annual time series of 5-year rates by ethnic groups common to 1991 and 2001 was obtained by averaging the results of equations (31) and (32). As examples, Figures 7(a) and (b) show ASFR trends for the White and the Bangladeshi ethnic groups between 1991 and 2009. This shows the fertility rates to be higher for Bangladeshi women in all age groups except those aged 40 and over in which a rise in rates for the White group is shown. In both groups, fertility is falling steadily for women in their 20s.\n\nLarge rises in fertility for White women in their 30s are not matched for Bangladeshi women. What about the future? Coleman and Dubuc (2010) demonstrate the usefulness of fitting a logistic curve to time trends of TFRs by ethnic group. To model variations over time in fertility by age group, we similarly fitted logistic curves to the 1991-2009 annual time series, but to each age-specific rate for each ethnic group. This procedure determines whether trends towards postponement are experienced by all ethnic groups. We extended the time series by using the fitted curves to predict age-specific rates up to 2021. These modeled curves are illustrated in Figure 7(c) and (d) for the White and Bangladeshi ethnic groups and show the trend in rates for each age group. Figures 7(e) and (f) combine the estimates and modeled curves by applying the trends of the logistic curves from the 2009 jump-off point. The reduction of rates for women in their 20s over time is clearly shown, as are the rises in rates for White women in their 30s and 40s. For Bangladeshi women over the age of 30, a continuation of rates at similar levels over time is projected.\n\nThe estimation of trends between 1991 and 2009 and curve fitting for the prediction of rates to 2021 were carried out for the eight ethnic groups common to the 1991 and 2001 Censuses. ASFRs for the more selective groups within the White and Other common groups were computed by applying growth (decline) rates for the broad group to the more selective groups they contained. We assumed that after 2021, ASFRs for each group would stay at the same level up to 2051, the final year of the projection model. When the projection was run, growth (decline) rates derived from our national time series were applied to the LA-level ASFRs by ethnic group. The relative level of fertility for local areas was therefore preserved but differences by ethnic group moved in proportion to national-level changes. The assumptions about ASFR\n\n\n\nThe authors are grateful for the comments of two anonymous referees.\n\nReferences\nBoden, P. and P. Rees. 2010.

Fertility increases with age at immigration, and is particularly high for those immigrating in late adolescence. This pattern prevails regardless of the country of origin, and of whether the mother tongue of the migrants was an official language in Canada. The fertility of those for whom it was an official language is always lower on average than of those for whom it was not, but there does not seem to be a critical age at which the fertility of the former and the latter starts to diverge. Formal education has an effect: the fertility of immigrants who arrived in Canada at any age before adulthood and who were or became college graduates is similar to that of their native peers.\n\nKeywords: fertility; migration; adoption; adaptation; assimilation; age at migration; language; education; Canada\n\n1. Introduction and Background\n\nWith rising dependency ratios produced by low fertility in Western OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries and the ageing of their baby-boom generations, immigrant flows have become an important factor in sustaining levels of public services and maintaining population growth. These flows have prompted a significant body of research on the fertility of immigrants, in particular on differences in fertility between immigrants and the native-born, and on whether these differences tend to disappear over the medium to long term. This research has been revealing about the socio-economic integration of immigrants, especially women because childbearing decisions are related to education and choices about participation in the labor market. A relatively high fertility rate among first-generation immigrants may hinder the economic success of female immigrants and have an adverse impact on the economic well-being of immigrant families and investments in the education of their children.\n\nCanada, with one of the largest shares of immigrants among Western nations\u2014around 20 percent of the population was born abroad\u2014is an interesting case for the study of immigrant fertility. Unlike other major destination countries, the Canadian Government has developed policies to attract educated immigrants and reward knowledge of local languages (English and French). Immigrants to Canada are admitted in three main categories\u2014\u2018skilled\u2019, \u2018family\u2019, and \u2018refugee\u2019\u2014and skilled immigrants currently account for around 60 percent of all new admissions. This policy results in an immigrant profile that is more educated and closer to that of native members of the host country than in other countries, such as the USA, and is likely to have important consequences for the assimilation of immigrants.\n\nThe fertility decisions of immigrants are ultimately determined by the opportunities and costs they encounter in their interaction with Canadians, and the circumstances they face in Canada. Immigrant women facing better labor market prospects in the host country than in their countries of origin may decide to reduce or postpone their fertility in order to work. The costs of using childcare services in the host country (where there may be no relatives to provide informal care) is another incentive to work rather than to have another child, and to devote more resources to the rearing of each child rather than to increase their number.\n\nAssimilation and the Role of Age at Migration\n\nUnlike previous research, which focused primarily on the fertility outcomes of adult migrants, the study presented here analyzed the fertility of immigrant women who arrived in Canada before the age of 19, and compared it with that of the native-born. We assumed that for individuals who migrate as children, the link between migration and subsequent fertility would be less directly affected by any short-term disruptive effects of the migration experience and less biased by selection. Child immigrants are likely to arrive with their parents and, as a result, their \u2018decision\u2019 to migrate is independent of other variables affecting fertility. Thus, by studying child migrants, we were able to focus on the assimilation process in the receiving country, and the role that age at migration played in it. Another reason for focusing on women who migrate as children and their age at immigration was the possibility that there might be critical ages at which individuals learn a particular behavior or skill, such as the local language, that are crucial for future social and economic outcomes.\n\nFluency in the language of the destination country has long been recognized as playing a key role in the immigrant\u2019s subsequent life course and degree of assimilation. In the case of fertility, having a mother tongue that is not an official language may affect the ability of the child migrant to form her fertility preferences by internalizing the local cultural cues from school and peers. Previous analyses have found greater English fluency to be associated with lower fertility in the USA. Moreover, it is well documented that fluency in the language of the destination country decreases with age at immigration, among other factors, and should therefore be greater for those migrants who arrive as children. In their paper, Bleakley and Chin show that the outcomes for immigrants from non-English-speaking countries to the USA consistently differ from those of other migrants only for those older than the \u2018critical ages\u2019 of 8-9 years on arrival. In the case of fertility, there may be an additional mechanism by which age at arrival is influential if cultural norms of reproductive behavior adopted at a young age continue to influence fertility decisions into adulthood.\nThe costs of using childcare services in the host country, where there may be no relatives to provide informal care, is another incentive to work rather than to have another child (see Carter 2000 for Mexicans in the USA), and to devote more resources to the rearing of each child rather than to increase their number (Becker 1981). The analysis of fertility differences between the immigrants and the native-born requires an understanding of the forces that shape the fertility choices of immigrants. In their seminal paper on this subject, Goldstein and Goldstein (1981) identify three important factors that explain the fertility behavior of migrants: selection, disruption, and adaptation. The selection hypothesis posits that individuals who migrate from their country of origin differ systematically from those who do not migrate, and this selectivity may explain their subsequent fertility patterns (Kahn 1988; Forste and Tienda 1996; Sobotka 2008). The second factor, disruption, refers to the actual and expected short-term disruption of fertility at the time of migration (Goldstein and Goldstein 1981; Ram and George 1990; Blau 1992; Stephen and Bean 1992; Kahn 1994; Ng and Nault 1997; Toulemon 2004). Finally, the adaptation hypothesis posits that, as migrants settle in their new environment, their fertility norms and expectations begin to resemble those of the native population (Goldstein and Goldstein 1981; Stephen and Bean 1992; Alba and Nee 1997).\n\nBecause the effects of the three factors proposed by the Goldsteins may coexist (or follow each other in quick succession), the separate role of each can be difficult to isolate and assess. Theoretically, it might be possible to observe an initial fall in fertility because of disruption at the time of immigration, followed by a subsequent rise in fertility, and then a gradual convergence with the fertility levels of the host country as immigrants adopt local norms. Hypotheses about the effects of each of the factors have been tested, but none has been conclusively accepted or rejected (Kulu 2005).\n\nAssimilation and the role of age at migration\n\nUnlike previous research, which focused primarily on the fertility outcomes of adult migrants, the study presented here analyzed the fertility of immigrant women who arrived in Canada before the age of 19, and compared it with that of the native-born. The data used were from the four Canadian censuses (20 percent sample) of 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006. We assumed that for individuals who migrate as children, the link between migration and subsequent fertility would be less directly affected by any short-term, disruptive effects of the migration experience and less biased by selection. Child immigrants are likely to arrive with their parents and, as a result, their \u2018decision\u2019 to migrate is independent of other variables affecting fertility. Thus, by studying child migrants, we were able to focus on the assimilation process in the receiving country, and the role that age at migration played in it. Related literature on economics has also recognized age at immigration as a decisive factor in explaining differentials in the process of immigrant assimilation measured by various socio-economic characteristics (Chiswick 1991; Picot and Sweetman 2005; Ferrer et al. 2006; Picot et al. 2007).\n\nAnother reason for focusing on women who migrate as children and their age at immigration was the possibility that there might be critical ages at which individuals learn a particular behavior or skill, such as the local language, that are crucial for future social and economic outcomes (Schaafsma and Sweetman 2001; Bleakley and Chin 2010). Fluency in the language of the destination country has long been recognized as playing a key role in the immigrant\u2019s subsequent life course and degree of assimilation (see, e.g., Kossoudji 1988; Dustmann 1994; Chiswick and Miller 2001, 2004; Schaafsma and Sweetman 2001; Dustmann and van Soest 2002; Bleakley and Chin 2004). Studies by Leslie and Lindley (2001) and Dustmann and Fabbri (2003), for example, find that lack of fluency in English has a detrimental effect on the employment and earnings of men and women in ethnic minorities in Britain. In the case of fertility, having a mother tongue that is not an official language may affect the ability of the child migrant to form her fertility preferences by internalizing the local cultural cues from school and peers. Previous analyses have found greater English fluency to be associated with lower fertility in the USA (Sorenson 1988; Swicegood et al. 1988; Bleakley and Chin 2010). Moreover, it is well documented that fluency in the language of the destination country decreases with age at immigration, among other factors (Chiswick 1991; Stevens 1992, 1999; Espenshade and Fu 1997; Espinosa and Massey 1997; Akresh 2007), and should therefore be greater for those migrants who arrive as children. In their paper, Bleakley and Chin (2010) show that the outcomes for immigrants from non-English-speaking countries to the USA consistently differ from those of other migrants only for those older than the \u2018critical ages\u2019 of 8-9 years on arrival. In the case of fertility, there may be an additional mechanism by which age at arrival is influential if cultural norms of reproductive behavior adopted at a particular age (for instance, at the onset of puberty) are resistant to change later on.\nData and empirical approach\n\nThe study presented in this paper focused on the total number of children born to women in Canada aged 16-45, by their migration status and a set of characteristics treated as independent variables. Because the dependent variable is an integer variable, we estimated it using a Poisson model of the following form:\nln E(Fi) = \u03a3 (bj Aji) + a Xi\nwhere Fi is the fertility measure of woman i; Aji is a set of indicator variables, one for each age at immigration, j, from under age 1 to age 18, which constitutes the main focus of our research, as well as a separate indicator for those arriving after age 18; X is a vector of demographic variables (that varies from model to model, according to specification). Canadian-born women were taken as the reference group. The estimated Poisson models always included a rural indicator and a set of dummy variables for the province of residence, and indicators for the 5-year age groups of the women to allow for differences in fertility over the life cycle. The model also included 5-year group indicators for birth cohorts to account for the fact that women born at different times might have different attitudes towards fertility and face different constraints on access to family planning, government services, and so on. Finally, indicators distinguishing the different census years were also added to account for possible survey-year effects. Since the census sample included respondents at different ages, we controlled for their varying exposure time to fertility (defined as age minus 15 years) in the models. We decided not to include income measures because it was not realistic to regard them as exogenous from fertility choices, and also because longitudinal information on income before births was not available. Including education in the analysis (see below) to some extent provided a control for potential income. Although we do not report estimates for all control variables in the paper, they show consistent results across all the model runs and are available on request.\n\nThe first set of Poisson models included the following elements: first, a specification with the basic covariates in equation (1); second, a specification that adds indicators for highest educational attainment (below high school, high school, non-university post-secondary education, and university education); and finally, a specification that adds region of birth. The inclusion of these indicators produced estimates of the effect of age at immigration on fertility that were net of educational or regional effects. However, the underlying assumption was that education and region of birth have a uniform effect on the fertility of immigrants, regardless of their age at immigration.\n\nNext, to study whether the fertility-change profile varied across regions of origin, a set of interactions between indicators of age at immigration and place of birth was added to the basic model.\n\nThe last two models in the study explored whether the two variables discussed in the previous section, language fluency and schooling, played a mediating role in the process of adopting the host country\u2019s fertility patterns. The Canadian census asks whether the respondent speaks one of the official languages, but does not ask about fluency. Because the ability to speak an official language is one of the criteria the Canadian Government uses to select immigrants, the variable is not very informative. As a result, the Canadian immigration literature has typically relied on mother tongue, the language that individuals first understood and could still understand, as a proxy for fluency. The advantage of mother tongue compared with self-reported fluency is that it is a fairly exogenous variable. Further, the \u2018distance\u2019 between the mother tongue and the official language of the destination country is generally related to labour market and education outcomes, as well as to migration flows. We created the indicator \u2018official mother tongue\u2019 (OMT) to indicate whether a woman\u2019s mother tongue was the same as, or different from, the prevalent official language in her province of residence. Although Canada recognizes two official languages, French is used mostly in Quebec and English elsewhere. Hence, a set of interaction terms between the OMT indicator and ages at immigration was added to the models to estimate the fertility profiles of immigrants with and without an OMT and compare them with the fertility of the Canadian-born. The last model added an interaction term between an indicator of university degree and age at immigration. This model produced estimates of the fertility profiles by age at migration of immigrants with and without university education, and compared them with similarly educated Canadian-born women.\n\nData\n\nThe data used in the study were obtained from the confidential files of the Canadian Census of Population (20 percent sample) for the years 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006. Confidential census data provide large samples that allow multiple analyses, yielding robust estimates. In addition, they include more detailed information on individuals, as well as a richer categorization of relationships between household members than in generally available data. With such information, we were able to compute the number of children of each woman living in the household. For each census year, we selected all non-aboriginal women aged between 16 and 45, and extracted the following information: education; marital status; number of live-born children (available in the 1991 Census); number of children living in the household; province of residence; and immigrant status. In addition, for immigrant women we collected their year of immigration, age at immigration, and country of birth. We grouped individuals by country of birth into 20 relatively homogenous regions (for a detailed listing, see Adsera and Ferrer 2011). \u2018Age at immigration\u2019 refers to the age at which the respondent became a permanent resident. Most child immigrants enter the country as permanent residents, so this should not have affected our sample greatly. To reduce computing time, for each census year we selected all immigrant women and a 20 percent random sample of women born in Canada, and weighted observations accordingly. Data from the four censuses were then pooled, giving approximately 1.8 million observations.\n\nIn general, in developed countries, vital statistics are the most accurate source of information on fertility. However, since they contain little additional information about the individual and household, they cannot be used for an in-depth analysis of fertility behavior. An alternative method is to estimate fertility indirectly from survey information such as census samples, which typically report the number of children living in the household. The method, known as the \u2018own child\u2019 method, relies on the fact that the vast majority of young children live with their mother. Since the date of birth of both mother and children is known, it is possible to reconstruct each woman\u2019s fertility history. Be\u00b4langer and Gilbert (2003) showed that when the difference between the fertility of the immigrants and that of the native-born was estimated by both methods for the period 1996-2001, the results did not differ appreciably; there was a smaller difference with census data for women younger than 30, and a larger difference for those aged over 30. We therefore used the number of children living in the household as our measure of fertility, the dependent variable in our models.\n\nTo the extent that some children may not have been living with their mothers, our dependent variable was underestimated. To minimize this problem, we restricted our sample to relatively young women (up to 45 years of age), whose children were more likely to be living at home. Nevertheless, several difficulties with the measure remained. First, the census questionnaire asks respondents to include children in joint custody who live most of the time in the household as household members. Therefore, our sample excluded all the children who were living exclusively with their father. Since young children were far more likely to live with their mothers than their fathers, even after marriage disruption, this was not an important factor for our analysis. Second, some of the children of older women may have already left home, which meant that their early childbearing would not have been included in the analysis. This could have had a particularly serious effect if the rates of departure of children from the household in their late adolescence or early adulthood (to attend college far from home, for early marriage or cohabitation, and so on) differed between immigrants and the Canadian-born.\n\nTo assess the importance of the potential bias introduced by our dependent variable, we undertook three types of tests for robustness. First, we used the information on the total number of children ever born to a woman, available from the 1991 Census, to re-estimate the models and compare the results with those obtained for the 1991 Census using our fertility measure. Second, we re-ran the models using a restricted sample of women aged up to 40 instead of 45. This reduced the likelihood that some of the children had already left home, but would have missed late childbearing (i.e., occurring between age 40 and 44), which may occur differentially between groups (e.g., according to education, country of origin, etc.). In a relevant study, Vezina and Turcotte (2009), after comparing data from the Canada census and from the General Social Survey, found that there was no appreciable difference in the characteristics (including immigrant status) of women aged from 40 to 44 with a child aged 5 or older, between those with some and those with none of their children living with them. Third, we re-ran the models restricting the children included in our fertility measure to those aged 18 or younger. Differences in the results when using this definition of the dependent variable would have indicated that the bias introduced by the \u2018own child\u2019 method was important. However, the overall pattern of the results and the estimated coefficients were found to be robust across these different samples and model runs. These results are available on request.\nThe results were found to be robust across these different samples and model runs. Descriptive statistics for the Canadian-born and the immigrants are presented in Table 1, which includes data from the 1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006 censuses as well as statistics for 1991 and 2006 separately to indicate changes over the period. Around 50 percent of immigrants arrived in Canada as adults, after the age of upper-secondary schooling, with peak ages of entry between 20 and 30 years. A substantial proportion, about 50 percent in the 1991 Census and 45 percent in the 2006 Census, arrived before adulthood and were the subject of the study. They were increasingly arriving from Asia and Africa, leading to a rising proportion of immigrants with a non-official mother tongue or using a non-official language at home. Canadian immigration policies focused on skill-based selection have led to the attraction of highly educated immigrants\u2014on average, 45 percent of immigrants had post-secondary education as compared to 37 percent of the Canadian-born.\n\nThe study used a sample of Canadian-born females and immigrant females for its analysis on immigrant fertility from 1991 to 2006. Descriptive statistics, such as the number of children, age, education, marital status, years since immigration, age at immigration, and country/region of origin, were considered crucial in understanding fertility choices.\n\nThe Poisson regressions performed indicated significant differences in fertility behavior due to factors like age at immigration and the level of education. Results were graphically presented as incidence rate ratios (IRRs), indicating immigrant females' fertility rates as a proportion of Canadian-born females' rates. Further analysis included factors like region of birth to account for cultural influences on fertility norms.\n\nThroughout the study, fertility generally increased with age at immigration. Furthermore, the inclusion of the educational attainment in the models slightly flattened the fertility rates profile for late adolescents. Including region of birth indicated significant differences across various ages of arrival compared to the native-born Canadians.\n\nThe study concluded that differences in the timing of births among child migrants were unlikely the reason for observed fertility patterns. Additionally, even after considering different origins, the fertility profiles by age at immigration showed significant variation, suggesting diverse adaptations of fertility norms among immigrants.\nFertility level. This third model specification implicitly assumed that the effect of age at immigration was the same for all countries of birth. We consider alternative possibilities below. Holding current age and birth cohort constant, fertility generally increases with age at immigration (lowest line in Figure 1). In the basic model, the fertility rate for women who migrated before age 6 is either somewhat lower than, or indistinguishable from, that of native-born women. The fertility rate for women who migrated to Canada between the ages of 7 and 11 is within a margin of only 3-4 per cent of that of the native-born. This difference increases to about 10 per cent for those who arrived during early adolescence (ages 12-15), and rises sharply from 22 per cent for late adolescents, age 16, to 28 per cent for those who arrived at age 17 and, finally, to 33 per cent for those who arrived at age 18. Adding education to the model changes fertility differences somewhat by slightly flattening the profile of fertility rates by age for arrivals in late adolescence. Once region of birth is included in the model, the estimated relative fertilities at most ages of arrival are significantly different from 1 (the baseline for the native-born). An interesting feature of Figure 1 is that, while there is no evidence of a sharp discontinuity in the fertility rate by age at immigration, there are slight steps at ages that roughly correspond to milestones in the schooling system (elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school). Further, fertility increases more gradually with age at immigration until early adolescence, and then rises at a faster pace during late adolescence. This result does not seem to be driven by a larger probability of intermarriage among those arriving at younger ages. In separate regressions, not shown here, we observe that immigrants in mixed marriages (married to native-born Canadians) showed similar increases in fertility with older age at immigration. The observed peak in fertility for those arriving in late adolescence could also be attributed in part to the phenomenon of \u2018child brides\u2019 prevalent in some European countries. However, this factor is unlikely to be important in Canada, which receives few immigrants from cultures favouring arranged marriages and has a more selective immigration policy regime than most European countries (Adsera and Ferrer 2011).\n\nA natural question to ask is whether the observed differences in total fertility by age at immigration are driven in part by differences in the timing of births. Our focus on child migrants ensures that these differences are not the result of the temporary disruption of fertility attributable to the process of immigration itself (Andersson 2004). On the other hand, if child migrants have their children much earlier in life than the Canadian-born, our estimates may portray a higher fertility among immigrants simply because they were closer to completing their childbearing. Ideally, the study would have focused on women who had already completed their fertility. That would not have been possible using census data since, as explained above, the data do not include a complete fertility history of women, and the \u2018own child\u2019 method is not suitable for older women. To investigate births to these older women, the full model was re-run with the sample of women restricted to those aged between 35 and 45. The results are very similar to those for the whole sample, with fertility rising with increased age at arrival and peaking for arrivals in late adolescence. This suggests that differences in the timing of births were unlikely to be the reason for the results in Figure 1. Estimates that take into account the region of birth are very similar to those that do not, which suggests that the results are not reflecting variation in age at arrival by country of origin. Nevertheless, in Table 2, the estimated IRRs by region of origin show large differences in fertility levels between groups. The fertility rate for immigrants from Mexico at each arrival age is 40 per cent higher than that of the reference group of US-born migrants. Other immigrant groups with high fertility rates are those from Central America, Africa (except South Africa), the Middle East, and Southern Asia. This implies that their relative fertility for each age at arrival shifts upward in relation to that of US-born migrants and that their fertility-age at migration profile has more exaggerated positive peaks. The reverse holds for Eastern European immigrants and those from elsewhere in Asia. Chinese immigrants exhibit the lowest fertility rate of all groups: it is only 0.73 times that of the US-born.\n\nLeaving aside country-of-birth differences in levels of fertility, does the fertility of each immigrant group show the same profile by age at immigration as that of the average migrant? To analyse whether child immigrants arriving from certain regions acquired the fertility norms of the host country more quickly than others with similar years of exposure, we included in the model a set of dummy variables for the interaction between region of birth and age at immigration. To distinguish distinct periods of exposure to these norms, we categorized age at immigration into five groups corresponding roughly to the different stages in the school system: those immigrating as pre-school children (aged 5 or under at the time of immigration); those immigrating as elementary school children (aged 6-11 at the time of immigration); those immigrating in early adolescence (aged 12-15) who were likely to enter junior high school; those immigrating in late adolescence (aged 16-18) who were still highly likely to receive some form of Canadian schooling; and, finally, those immigrating at ages older than 18. This categorization was intended to avoid putting children entering Canada with different levels of schooling in the same group, as doing so might have affected any interaction effects (Khmelkov and Hallinan 1999). We also grouped countries into broader regions (USA/Europe, Middle East, South Asia, Other Asia and the Pacific, Africa, and South America including Central America) to make the differences more obvious when represented graphically.\n\nThe results in Figure 2 reveal that fertility increases with age at immigration, reaching a peak in late adolescence for all regions of origin. The only difference between regions is in the level of fertility. Immigrants from the Middle East display high fertility rates even if they had arrived before age 6 (approximately 7 per cent higher than the native-born), while the fertility rate of those arriving between birth and age 5 is relatively low among Africans and South Asians (around 15 per cent lower than that of the native-born), and even lower for immigrants from the Rest of Asia and the Pacific (around 30 per cent lower). The fertility rates of immigrants from the Middle East and South Asia increase sharply with age at immigration (for these immigrants the fertility of the oldest at arrival is 70 per cent greater than that of the youngest). Immigrants from Africa and the Rest of Asia and the Pacific also show a similar sharp increase in the fertility rate with age at immigration (the fertility of the oldest being 41 and 32 per cent greater than that of the youngest, respectively). The increase is more moderate for American immigrants.\n\nThese patterns suggest that the adoption of Canadian fertility norms is a relatively smooth process for the US/Europeans, South Americans and Middle Easterners, and that the younger they arrived in Canada, the more their fertility resembles that of the native-born. Immigrants from Africa and South Asia show a somewhat different pattern: the fertility levels of those arriving very young are significantly lower than those of the Canadian-born, but are larger for immigrants arriving at older ages. For those arriving from the Rest of Asia and the Pacific, fertility is below that of the native-born at all ages of immigration, and particularly so for the youngest ages at arrival, though the fertility of those arriving in their late adolescence just reaches that of the Canadian-born.\n\nIt may seem paradoxical to refer to the adoption of Canadian fertility norms for those immigrant groups that have lower fertility than the native-born, but we believe that our findings are partly the result of differences in the age and educational profiles of the different groups. For example, among those who arrived between birth and age 5, the proportion who were still under 25 years of age and so were far from having completed their fertility at the time of the census ranged from around 28 per cent for US/European migrants, to around 55 per cent for Africans and South Americans, and almost two-thirds for those from the \u2018Rest of Asia and the Pacific\u2019 and the Middle East. Although the models controlled for age, they may not have accounted completely for the interactions of age and region of birth that might explain these findings. Because age indicators only account for the average effect for all immigrants, it is possible that some groups of immigrants in particular those who arrived before middle-school age from the Rest of Asia and the Pacific, and who were still young differed from the native-born in their preferences for both fertility and schooling. Given the available sample sizes, it was impossible to include a complete set of interactions of age, schooling, and region of origin in a model to investigate such patterns.\nHowever, when we restricted the sample to women aged 35 and older, or to those from the birth cohort 1961-66 most of whose childbearing was known, the expected pattern of adopting local fertility norms was observed, regardless of region of birth. The results show that the fertility of immigrants who arrived between birth and age 5 is relatively similar to that of the native-born (and only slightly below that of those from the Rest of Asia and the Pacific), and exceeds it at older ages at immigration for all groups. Whether today\u2019s young child migrants from these regions will follow the same pattern as the older cohorts remains to be seen. Judging from the behaviour of the older cohorts, it is possible that the younger ones are just delaying fertility to a greater extent than the native-born.\n\nAge at immigration and language fluency using IRRs, Figure 3 presents fertility by age at immigration separately for those with and those without an OMT as well as the fertility of Canadian women with an OMT relative to Canadian women without an OMT. For migrants, the figure displays the IRRs of US immigrants (relative to native-born women without an OMT). The figure shows that the fertility rate of Canadian-born women with an OMT is 5 percent higher than the rate of those without one. This finding is consistent with previous research showing that second-generation immigrants in Canada have lower fertility levels, on average, than both first-generation and third-generation Canadians. Immigrants who do not have an OMT have higher fertility rates than any other group, even if they arrived at very young ages. The fertility of US immigrants with an OMT who migrated before age 5 is similar to that of the Canadian-born. The relative fertility of both those with and those without an OMT increases with age at immigration, although the increase is steeper for the latter (particularly for those who arrived as adolescents). Unlike studies of US immigrants, we do not find a 'critical age' (e.g., middle school) at which the fertility of immigrants who have an OMT starts to diverge sharply from the fertility of those who do not have one. Nevertheless, since there are persistent differences in fertility between these two groups, it seems clear that language fluency, as a proxy for the first language spoken by the immigrant as a child, plays a mediating role (presumably by making it easier for those with an OMT to be sensitive to the influences that lead to the adoption of local fertility norms). The finding applies both to speaking French in Quebec and to speaking English in the rest of Canada. However, the fact that relative fertility increases with the age at immigration, even among those with an OMT, suggests that language fluency is not the main influence on the extent to which the fertility of child immigrants resembles that of the native-born.\n\nAge at immigration and education Figure 4 shows the fertility of immigrants with, and without, a university education relative to that of native-born Canadians without a university education. Immigrants without a university education follow the pattern shown in Figure 1 of increasing fertility with older age at immigration, and their fertility is statistically significantly higher than that of the corresponding native-born, even for those who migrated at very young ages. By contrast, the fertility of immigrants with a university education is fairly independent of their age at immigration, and similar to that of the Canadian-born with a university education, except for a slight increase for those who arrived at age 18. Similar results are obtained for comparisons using college or other forms of post-secondary education. Further, when the model was estimated with three levels of schooling\u2014below high school, high school, and college\u2014differentials in fertility relative to that of the native-born by age at immigration were apparent mainly for those who had not completed secondary education. To check that age factors were not responsible for the results, we re-estimated this model using the 1961-66 birth cohort and also, separately, the sample of women aged over 35, and obtained the same pattern of results. In addition, the profiles of ages at immigration were relatively flat for the university educated, regardless of the region of birth.\n\nThese findings suggest that, for child immigrants, their educational achievement and the degree to which they adopt the fertility norms of the native-born are closely associated. However, since these are reduced-form estimates, they fail to take into account the fact that decisions about schooling and fertility may be made jointly, and how norms for these two factors are transmitted inter-generationally. No causal statements can be made since unobserved heterogeneity (for example, in preferences for work and children) may be driving both education and fertility choices.\nThe study we have described focused on the behavior of immigrant women arriving in Canada before age 19. The fertility of those who migrate before adulthood is unlikely to be affected by disruption around the time of migration or by any association between the timing of migration and family formation that might boost fertility immediately after arrival, as suggested by the family-formation hypothesis. Moreover, a strong selection bias for fertility among child migrants at the individual level is also unlikely. Hence, although we cannot entirely discount the selection hypothesis, the adoption of host-country norms is clearly the most plausible mechanism for this group. Child immigrants have more time than adult immigrants to internalize the host country\u2019s fertility norms, since most of their childhood socialization takes place in the destination country. Of course, selection may still play a role at the household or family level, and the host country\u2019s policy may have an influence at this level. For example, the Canadian immigration system, which awards more points to the highly educated, might have an indirect influence on their offspring\u2019s educational achievement. In addition, parents who value education may be more likely to migrate than others, and they might also choose to move while their children are young enough to benefit from the educational opportunities available in the destination country. \n\nWe hypothesized that the younger immigrants were when they arrived in Canada, the closer would be their fertility patterns to those of the native-born. This hypothesis was confirmed. Our analysis shows that there is indeed a positive relationship between relative fertility and age at immigration, with a steeper increase for those arriving in later adolescence. This association between fertility and age at immigration is similar for different groups of immigrants from different regions of the world, although their actual fertility levels vary.\n\nOn the other hand, in contrast to our expectations, very young immigrants from Asia and Africa have significantly lower fertility than the Canadian-born and, in the case of those from the Rest of Asia and the Pacific, only those who arrive during their late adolescence are likely to reach Canadian-born levels of fertility. However, when we examined the fertility patterns of older women (whose childbearing was almost complete) from those regions, the expected pattern\u2014adoption of local fertility norms\u2014was apparent, regardless of the region of birth. It appears that recent immigrants from these areas who arrived at very young ages might be following a very different pattern, with higher levels of schooling and later childbearing than the similarly aged native-born.\n\nIn exploring plausible determinants of assimilation, we assessed the influence of language fluency and educational attainment. Unlike studies on other immigrant outcomes, we do not find a sharp discontinuity in immigrant fertility behavior relative to the native-born among migrants who arrive at ages younger than the age of entry into middle school and whose mother tongue is different from that of the destination country, and among those who arrive later. Their relative fertility increases with age at arrival. Moreover, the fertility of immigrants with an other mother tongue (OMT) also diverges from that of the native-born increasingly with older age at immigration, though it remains lower than that of immigrants without an OMT for all ages of arrival.\n\nWhen child immigrants are grouped by educational level, increasing fertility with older age at arrival is apparent only among less educated immigrants. The fertility of university-educated young immigrants is similar to that of the native-born, regardless of their age at arrival and region of birth. The findings are robust to variation in a number of possible confounding factors, including language spoken at home, intermarriage, and language of the spouse. \n\nSome questions about the mechanisms by which fertility norms are acquired remain unanswered. We find evidence that educational level is more closely associated than language fluency with the adoption of local fertility norms. This may be the result of variability in factors that we have not taken into account and that may determine both education and fertility choices; perhaps women who have low preferences for childbearing choose high levels of education. This type of selection problem is well known in research on women\u2019s fertility decisions, since most variables that determine fertility are likely to be matters of choice themselves. Conventional methods of dealing with selection bias rely on using longitudinal data, which were not available to us. The use of instrumental variables is also limited because these estimators are not yet computationally developed for use with count models involving large numbers of independent variables. Future research could usefully focus on the endogeneity of education and how it is associated with immigrant children\u2019s experience as parents and participants in the labor force.\nBecker, Gary. 1981.

Our objective was to analyse the mortality effects of earlier income changes more generally, net of the overall level. We used Norwegian register data that included individual histories of annual labour income and focused on mortality among men aged 50-69 in 1990-2002. Men in this age group who, during the preceding 15 years, had experienced at least two substantial falls in income as well as at least one substantial increase, or vice versa, experienced an excess mortality of 17 percent. For men who experienced fewer changes, there were only weak indications of excess mortality. Variation dominated by falls in income did not have a more adverse effect than variation dominated by rises.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn inverse relationship between the chance that a person of a certain age dies and his or her income a few years earlier has been established in many studies. The relationship is thought to reflect the causal effects of material disadvantages resulting from low income and the associated psychosocial stress, as well as selection. Much attention has also been devoted to health and mortality among persons who have recently experienced income decline, in particular as a result of unemployment. Furthermore, there has been an increasing interest in examining the importance of income levels and income changes further back in time, which may be considered part of a broader effort to learn about the health implications of experiences and exposures in earlier stages of the life course.\n\nIn studies of earlier income, various measures of the lifetime income level have been included in the regression models, and some authors have examined effects of the number of income falls or the number of spells of poverty. A few investigators have also estimated how various measures of health status are influenced by earlier income changes more generally, in particular by also considering income increases. For example, studies reported effects of income change over the previous years on circulatory diseases, studying the effects of changes in absolute and relative income over a decade period on two health outcomes at the end of the period, and measured the effects of income decline and income increase over the years preceding their study.\n\nThese analyses aim to control for common individual determinants of income and health that are unobserved and constant, using a fixed-effects or difference-in-difference approach. In such designs, the aim is to identify the effect of the income level through the relationship between changes in income and changes in health. The focus on income changes is purely instrumental, and there is no interest or focus on any substantive effect of the change itself.\n\nThe aim of our study was to add to knowledge of the effects of earlier income changes on mortality, effects we believe to be considerably more complex than is reflected in reports of previous studies. Our analysis focused on the impact of changes over and beyond their effects through the income level. This distinction is lacking in many existing studies, which often do not condition on the income level when estimating effects of income change. In consequence, the resulting estimates are somewhat hard to interpret.\nThese analyses aim to control for common individual determinants of income and health that are unobserved and constant, using a fixed-effects or difference-in-difference approach.

The focus on income changes is purely instrumental, and there is no interest or focus on any substantive effect of the change itself.\n\nThe aim of our study was to add to knowledge of the effects of earlier income changes on mortality, effects we believe to be considerably more complex than is reflected in reports of previous studies. Our analysis focused on the impact of changes over and beyond their effects through the income level. This distinction is lacking in many existing studies, which often do not condition on the income level when estimating effects of income change. In consequence, the resulting estimates are somewhat hard to interpret. For example, to some extent the effects of income falls can reflect the fact that individuals who have had many falls have had a generally low overall income level, or at least currently have a relatively low income level. Furthermore, we considered not only income falls but also income rises, which have received little attention in previous studies. Taking income change in both directions into account is valuable even if the main goal is to assess the impact of income falls. In particular, an observed income decline may either be the end of a peak or the start of a trough, so that what seem to be the effects of income declines may actually also reflect the effects of income variation more generally, including increases. This fact seems not to have been fully appreciated in earlier studies.\n\nWe seek to contribute both theoretically and empirically to an understanding of the effects of income change on mortality and divide the paper into two main parts accordingly. In the first part of the paper we analyze theoretically how income change, through various mechanisms, may produce effects on mortality that are far from self-evident. The arguments build on common ideas about the material and psychosocial effects of economic resources. We take these ideas one step further by incorporating ideas from consumer theory on how consumption at a certain point in time depends on the income trajectory, and by making an assumption about the individual\u2019s own past being a relevant reference point in the psychosocial pathway. Additionally, we build on widely accepted notions about diminishing health returns to consumption and long-term health implications of earlier health and health behavior.\n\nIn the second part of the paper, we report the use of Norwegian register data to estimate the effects of income change, given the income level. The data we used are very rich in that they included complete cohorts and allowed us to consider income changes over a longer period (15 years) than commonly used in such investigations. As we discuss in the theory section, we would ideally have studied the role of both individual and household income, but our data allowed only the former. Because men have been the main wage earners, especially during the first decades covered by the data, the development over time in individual income has been more similar to the development in household income for men than for women. We have therefore chosen to study men exclusively. The second main limitation of our data is that we were not able to identify those who had retired. To exclude the majority of the retired, we set an upper age limit at age 69.\n\nMore specifically, we estimated discrete-time hazard regression models for mortality of men aged 50-69 in 1990-2002. The models included the number of income rises and falls over the preceding 15 years, or alternatively the standard deviation from trend. While much of the existing literature on income decline has focused on the most dramatic reductions, such as those caused by unemployment or movement into poverty (which is generally uncommon in Nordic countries), our measures capture more moderate changes as well.\n\nGeneral ideas about the effects of earlier income changes rest on four general ideas or assumptions. Firstly, a person\u2019s consumption of health-promoting goods is positively influenced by his or her income at that point and negatively affected by uncertainty about future income. Secondly, consumption or income relative to certain standards or expectations may also have a health effect through a psychosocial pathway. Thirdly, the health influences of income are likely to be concave. Finally, health and health behavior at any point in an individual\u2019s life probably have long-term implications.\nAssociated with poorer health outcomes are income variability and job insecurity, which can be tightly connected in several situations. However, there are also reasons to expect similar stress effects from the more general economic insecurity embodied in income variation.\n\nThere is a growing research literature on the shape of the relationship between recent income and health outcomes. The results are not fully consistent, but the majority of studies report that the relationship is not uniformly linear. Rather, the contribution to better health from a given increase in income tends to be higher at lower levels of income than at higher levels, indicating that the function is concave. Some studies find more extreme versions with a threshold value beyond which there is little or no effect of additional income.\n\nIt is a core idea in life-course epidemiology that health and health behavior in one period have implications for later health and mortality. More precisely, the effects of income on health and health behavior discussed above probably have consequences for mortality many years later. Stated differently, mortality in any given year depends on the accumulated effects of earlier health and health behavior and thus a long income history. On the other hand, income in the most recent years is still likely to be more important than income in earlier years.\n\nWe now explain how income changes may affect mortality, given the general ideas just presented, and identify three main causal pathways. By 'change' we mean a substantial difference compared not only to one particular year but to a longer period that may reflect the income level that, to some extent, the individual has become used to and may expect for the future. Such differences are most likely to have implications for consumption and be relevant for psychosocial stress mechanisms.\n\nThe experience of an income change in either direction will generally increase uncertainty about future incomes, at least if the change is unanticipated. This uncertainty may induce psychosocial stress that is detrimental to health. Uncertainty may also lead to precautionary saving and thus a lower level of consumption of health-promoting goods. It seems plausible to suppose that the more changes a person has experienced, the stronger the feeling of uncertainty.\n\nThe second pathway follows from the assumed concavity of the relationship between income and health. Under the concavity assumption, an individual with periods of income fluctuation (below and above average) will generally exhibit higher mortality compared to someone with a constant income level, an application of Jensen's inequality.\n\nThe third pathway applies only if psychosocial stress is affected by comparisons with own income levels in the past. An income fall then has an additional detrimental effect on mortality because it entails a feeling of deprivation relative to earlier years, while an income increase lowers mortality because it entails a relative improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, two mechanisms produce the detrimental health effects of both an income rise and an income fall (though not necessarily equally strong), conditional on average income. The third mechanism is asymmetric and produces a beneficial effect of an income rise that in principle might outweigh the adverse effects.\n\nIndividual and household income are relevant in different ways for assessing the impact of income changes on health. For the material consumption effects, household income is probably at least as influential as individual income, both because of its importance for individual consumption and because it is a key determinant of the joint household consumption from which all members may benefit. For the psychosocial pathway, empirical evidence suggests that individual income may be just as relevant as, or even more relevant than, household income, particularly for comparisons with past years. \n\nWhen calculating household income one should adjust for household composition. Given the focus on income changes, using such an adjusted measure introduces new complications. For example, a pronounced reduction in adjusted household income could be entirely due to the birth of a child while both parents maintain their incomes. Such household changes may themselves have, or be associated with, conditions that have consequences for health and health behavior quite different from those concerned here. \n\nIt is not obvious whether individual income or household income is the most relevant. Since there are specific advantages and disadvantages associated with both, one should ideally use individual income and household income alternately in complementary analyses.\nConfounding by closely associated factors. Because few researchers have had access to data that allow the effects of income and those of work to be separated, the effects of observed changes in income usually also reflect effects of changes in work activity. Most importantly, many episodes of substantial income reductions are caused by unemployment. Unemployment can also affect mortality through other mechanisms, including increased psychosocial stress due to not being at work, feeling of shame, and disadvantages associated with a less structured daily life and less contact with colleagues. Several investigations have documented stress responses to unemployment. When it comes to income rises, the story may be quite different. A person earning a temporarily high income may be working extraordinary hours due to good opportunities, which is associated with excess mortality, at least in the short term. Other factors may also affect a person's work activity and income and mortality as well.\n\nPart 2: An empirical analysis based on Norwegian register data covers the period up to and including 2002, extracted from the Norwegian population register, annual pre-tax labor incomes from 1968 to 2002, and educational attainment. The data analyzed mortality from 1990 to 2002 and its relationship with income history over the preceding 22 years. Income variation within a 15-year period was examined. The pre-tax labor income included unemployment benefits and temporary sickness benefits but excluded pensions and permanent disability benefits. By not accounting for income from savings and other assets or by excluding retired individuals from the analysis, the focus was narrowed to those under 69 years of age. \n\nStatistical Model: Discrete-time hazard models were estimated. These models included a series of 1-year observations starting in 1990 or when men turned 50, continuing until 2002, age 69, or the date of death or last emigration. The models considered both the income shortly before the time of exposure and the average income over earlier years, using log transformations to reflect the expected concave relationship. The income variation was also measured.\n\nDefinition of income changes: Considering the general upward drift in incomes, changes were defined relative to an underlying trend calculated from a 5-year average. An income fall was defined as a decline to a value 15% below the average income over the five preceding years, with subjects classified based on their experience of such falls over a 15-year period. Income rises were defined as increases of at least 30% relative to the average over the preceding five years. The effect of income variability was further analyzed using an indicator of the standard deviation from the trend. \n\nSelection and causality: The relationship between income and health was interpreted cautiously due to potential confounding factors such as individual risk-taking behaviors, occupational characteristics, and health conditions that could affect income and mortality. Only education, age, and period were controlled in the analysis to reduce the most apparent effects of selection for health.\n\nResults: Summary statistics indicated that 42% of the men had experienced at least one income fall as defined by our criterion during the study period. The analysis provided insights into the relationships between income fluctuations and mortality while taking into account the complexity of the underlying factors.\nJappelli and Pistaferri (2010) considered differentiation by income variation unnecessary in our context, hence we avoided such distinctions. Specifically, an income fall was defined as a decline to a value 15 percent below the average income over the preceding five years, categorizing individuals based on their experience of none, one, or two or more such falls within a 15-year period. Owing to an overall upward income trend, a higher threshold was set for income increases, only considering rises of at least 30 percent relative to the previous five-year average.\n\nIndividuals were similarly grouped based on the frequency of these income rises. The chosen thresholds were somewhat arbitrary yet they provided a balanced representation of income volatility, as seen in the symmetric frequencies of income falls and rises. This symmetry was maintained even when different reference periods (3 or 7 years) were tested against the standard 5-year period used.\n\nThe methodology notably differentiated types of income shifts. For instance, a 10 percent increase in income relative to the five-year average, followed by a 10 percent decrease the next year, would not qualify as a fall, even if the overall change exceeded 15 percent. This approach focuses on significant declines rather than moderate fluctuations. Conversely, for income peaks followed by reductions, the decline counts only if the new high level persists long enough to elevate the five-year average significantly.\n\nOur model identified two key properties: it avoided recognizing regular, substantial income increases as multiple rises unless each was sufficiently large, and treated steady, sizable decreases similarly.\n\nWe also explored a broader model incorporating a measure of income volatility, calculated as the square root of the average squared deviations from the five-year average income. Unlike traditional standard deviation estimates, our model didn't overly penalize steady income trends.\n\nIn studying the relationship between income and health, one must consider numerous confounding factors influencing both wages and health outcomes, such as occupational risks and personal health conditions, which could both reflect and influence income variability. Recognizing these complexities, our study controlled for education, age, and period using administrative registry data, acknowledging that these variables might not capture all nuances influencing employment and health.\n\nAnalyzed data showed 42 percent of men experienced at least one major income drop, and 40 percent witnessed at least one significant rise over the periods studied. Income two years prior inversely correlated with mortality, with more pronounced effects seen in groups with the highest income fluctuations. Variations in mortality rates were not significantly attributed to fluctuations around the major income changes, suggesting that minor deviations had a negligible impact on the broader trends observed. \n\nUltimately, consistent with previous findings, higher educational levels and recent income positively influenced survival rates, while variations in long-term income did not significantly alter mortality risks beyond those captured by recent income levels. This nuanced understanding of income dynamics underscores the complex interplay between economic factors and health outcomes.\nWhen the indicator of income variation was excluded from the model, the effect of the average income was significant (0.884, CI 0.796-0.980) and was almost the same as the effect of income 2 years before the time of exposure. The low mortality seen among those with a high average income according to this simpler model seems to be explained by the lower amount of variation in this group. We also tried different limits in our classification of income falls and rises, counting reductions of 30 percent and increases of 50 percent. The pattern was quite similar, with 16 percent excess mortality among those men who had experienced at least one fall and at least one decline. There was symmetry with respect to falls and increases. The most striking difference was the clearer excess mortality among the very few who had experienced two declines and no rise, or vice versa.\n\nIn the next step, we included an alternative measure of income variability: the standard deviation from the trend, as measured by the average over the five preceding years (mean 46.8, standard deviation 134.43). With this specification, both the effect of recent income and the effect of average income are significant, and they are of the same size. High variability raises mortality significantly, though it is not an effect that matters substantively. For example, a one-standard-deviation increase in variability is associated with only a 0.8 percent increase in mortality.\n\nWhen this alternative measure of income variation was included in addition to the other main measure of income variation, the effects of the main measure were essentially the same as those shown previously, and the effect of the alternative measure was far from significant (p=0.41). In other words, there does not seem to be an additional effect of small variation around the larger falls and rises considered in the main measure, and the alternative measure is not able to capture much of the effect of these larger changes.\n\nInterestingly, mortality seems to increase by just as much regardless of whether the income variation is dominated by falls or increases. This does not accord equally well with all the above-mentioned ideas, and may suggest that the concavity argument or the uncertainty argument, which do not involve the direction of the changes to the same extent as the other arguments, is relatively important. On the other hand, one may consider the findings as lending little support to the argument about income relative to the past few years, which predicts higher mortality among those experiencing more falls than rises, than among those experiencing the opposite.\n\nWe believe the quality of the income histories was high, since they were based on tax registers rather than personal recollections. We were also able to exclude individuals with periods abroad when they may have had incomes not registered by Norwegian authorities. However, the study also had some limitations related to the fact that changes in labour income are due to any combination of changes in working hours and changes in hourly wages. The adverse effects of income change that we observe may to some extent reflect the negative consequences for health of the non-economic effects of unemployment or even of voluntary increases in working hours. The separation of such effects is generally difficult, and was not facilitated by the data available to us. Furthermore, we may not have fully excluded the retired, who have a much higher purchasing power than is indicated by their labour income, and we have not been able to take into account financial incomes from savings and other assets, wealth, taxes, and public transfers, all of which are important for people\u2019s purchasing power.\n\nOur analysis suggests that earlier studies of the effects of income reductions have missed some of the story. A change that is considered to be a fall can actually be either the beginning of a trough or the end of a peak, which substantively are two quite different phenomena. What are referred to as estimates of effects of income falls can therefore reflect a combination of rises and falls, both of which may have an adverse effect on mortality according to our theoretical arguments and empirical results. In fact, when a fall is observed, it is quite likely that there have been several falls and rises (i.e., a fall can primarily be an indication of a generally large variation). Therefore, one should consider income variation in more detail than has been done in previous studies. However, it is not obvious what kind of income changes could reasonably be considered falls and rises. How large should the change be, and compared to what? If income is compared with the income level in earlier years, how many years should be taken into account? Is the average the most relevant measure, or should the direction of the trend within the period also be considered as an indication of what the individual might expect for the ensuing years? We chose a definition that we believe made good sense, but further refinements should be a topic for future research.\n\nWe hope that our findings and arguments will stimulate additional research on the association between income variation and mortality, preferably using data that include information on all types of income, for all household members. With such data, the analysis could easily be extended to women and to the retired. Studies that were able to control better for selection would also be welcome. If patterns similar to the ones we have identified are confirmed in these studies, the implications for public health would be that there is a rationale for avoiding large income variation, and that individuals who have highly varying incomes may deserve special attention.\nIndividual income or household income. Our study deals with only one of the four. For two main reasons, we might have seen different patterns if we had considered women instead of men in our analysis based on individual income. Firstly, the relative importance of changes in individual income and changes in household income may be different for women. For example, the psychosocial effects of success relative to the past in terms of own income may generally be less prominent for women. Secondly, the relationship between changes in individual income and changes in household income is probably also different, because on average women contribute less to household income.\n\nFurthermore, it was a limitation of our study that we controlled only for age, period, and education, given that several other factors may affect mortality and working hours and wages. It should be noted, however, that we also experimented with including marital status and crude measures of occupation in some models, but did not find this to alter the results in any important way.\n\nBroader implications\n\nSome recent studies have shown pro-cyclical mortality at the aggregate level, although there is no agreement about whether this is because working-age adults themselves have a different lifestyle when incomes are higher and they perhaps work more, or whether everyone is adversely influenced by the generally higher income levels and economic activity (e.g., Tapia Granados 2005; Ruhm 2007; Miller et al. 2009). It is not obvious what our study adds to this discussion. We show that an increase in income raises mortality, but this estimate is from a model where the income level is controlled for. The overall effect of an income increase cannot be predicted from our results, because an income increase will also contribute positively to the income level, and therefore positively to health.\n\nThe main message\n\nOur analysis suggests that earlier studies of the effects of income reductions have missed some of the story. A change that is considered to be a fall can actually be either the beginning of a trough or end of a peak, which substantively are two quite different phenomena. What are referred to as estimates of effects of income falls can therefore reflect a combination of rises and falls, both of which may have an adverse effect on mortality according to our theoretical arguments and empirical results. In fact, when a fall is observed, it is quite likely that there have been several falls and rises (i.e., a fall can primarily be an indication of a generally large variation). Therefore, one should consider income variation in more detail than has been done in previous studies. However, it is not obvious what kind of income changes could reasonably be considered falls and rises. How large should the change be, and compared to what? If income is compared with the income level in earlier years, how many years should be taken into account? Is the average the most relevant measure, or should the direction of trend within the period also be considered as an indication of what the individual might expect for the ensuing years? We chose a definition that we believe made good sense, but further refinements should be a topic for future research.\n\nWe hope that our findings and arguments will stimulate additional research on the association between income variation and mortality, preferably using data that include information on all types of income, for all household members. With such data, the analysis could easily be extended to women and to the retired. Studies that were able to control better for selection would also be welcome. If patterns similar to the ones we have identified are confirmed in these studies, the implications for public health would be that there is a rationale for avoiding large income variation, and that individuals who have highly varying incomes may deserve special attention.\nMackenbach, J.

Ediev\nVienna Institute of Demography\n\nWhen pension systems are contrasted, it is common to use simplified demographic models, such as overlapping generation models with time-invariant mortality. Breaking with this tradition, we show that for a population with increasing longevity, the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system may be more advantageous than a funded system (FS). Increasing longevity favours the PAYG system because for the workers living longer at retirement than current retirees, it is less costly to fund others' current pensions than their own. At present, the effect amounts to around 15 percent in terms of the dependency ratio, six more years at work in the FS, or 1 percent per annum in terms of the real interest rate. In most developed countries, the effect substantially exceeds that of the usually studied biological interest rate.\n\nKeywords: pensions; changing mortality; pay-as-you-go pension system; funded pension system; old-age dependency ratio; internal rate of return\n\n1. Introduction\nIn developed countries, populations are ageing due to increasing longevity and, in many instances, low fertility. This has put the solvency of pension systems at risk, despite the counterbalancing effect of immigration. The severity of the problem has been exacerbated by three factors: the inability of countries to meet the European Council's Lisbon targets for adult employment by 2010; public resistance to recent attempts to delay retirement; and growing antipathy to immigration. To address this, attention has shifted to the possibilities of structural reform of existing pension systems. Of particular interest has been the idea of shifting from the PAYG system, in which pensions are financed by contributions from those currently in the labour force, to a combination with the funded system (FS), where pensions are paid from accumulated savings. It is assumed that different pension systems respond differently to demographic developments, particularly that the FS system is not as directly affected by the changing population age composition as the PAYG system.\n\nPopulation Studies analyses have thoroughly explored the role of demographic change in applied studies of particular pension schemes, including simulations of their solvency and usually employing carefully prepared population projections. However, comparisons of alternative pension designs often rely on simplified demographic models that assume constant mortality. These simplifications may be a response to the complexity of the issue, which requires a comprehensive treatment that considers economic, political, behavioural, and social factors as well as purely demographic ones.\n\nRecently, Settergren and Mikula emphasized the importance of increasing longevity as a factor favouring the PAYG system and partially accounted for changing mortality by supplementing Aaron's equation for the PAYG rate of return with the effect of change in turnover duration. As life expectancy increases, so does the turnover duration, thereby improving the PAYG internal rate of return.\n\n2. Data and mortality scenarios\nWe used mortality data from the Human Mortality Database and our own forecasts averaged over the low-mortality populations in 24 countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, and others. We projected the period life expectancy at birth to reach 90 years in 2050, and 28.2 years at age 65 in our main scenario, based on recent extrapolations that are more optimistic than official forecasts. These projections are consistent with linear growth in period life expectancy over the next two decades.\n\nAn alternative scenario was developed based on the traditional procedure of extrapolating declining age-specific mortality rates. This produced a period life expectancy of 85 years in 2050 for low-mortality countries, which is consistent with projections by the United Nations and Eurostat and substantially lower than our main scenario.\n\nOur study compared the effects of changing mortality on PAYG and FS schemes and their implications for the dependency ratio, age at retirement, and rate of return. We also specified some basic ageing indicators for situations of changing mortality and derived some analytical results, providing a comprehensive analysis of how increasing longevity impacts pension systems.\nThe same also applies to more recent analyses and discussion (Willis 1988; Lee 1994; Sinn 2000; Galasso and Profeta 2002; Bommier and Lee 2003; Lee and Mason 2011). Recently, Settergren and Mikula (2005) stressed the importance of increasing longevity as a factor favoring the PAYG system and did partially take changing mortality into account. They did so by supplementing Aaron\u2019s equation for the PAYG rate of return by the effect of change in turnover duration (the difference between the contribution-or-benefit-weighted mean ages of retiree and contributor). As life expectancy increases, so does the turnover duration, which, in turn, improves the PAYG internal rate of return. However, their base model assumes a stable population, which is only possible after mortality has stayed constant for a long period; the effects of demographic change are estimated as the difference between two different stable population scenarios. Bommier and Lee (2003) also considered changing mortality in their general conditions for balancing pension systems, but did not investigate the effects in their model.\n\nIn the study presented here, we compared the effect of changing mortality on PAYG and FS schemes and its implications for dependency ratio, age at retirement, and the rate of return. We also specified some basic aging indicators for situations of changing mortality, and derived some analytical results. Assuming realistic mortality scenarios for developed countries, we contrasted the effect of increasing longevity with that of other drivers of population aging.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Data and scenarios are described in Section 2; the effects of changing mortality on old-age dependency ratios are presented in Section 3; the results for age at retirement and the rates of return in Sections 4 and 5; and a sensitivity analysis, using an alternative scenario for future mortality in Section 6. Finally, results for individual countries are given and discussed. The Appendix contains derivations of the equations in the text.\n\nWe used mortality data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD 2012) and our own forecasts averaged over the low-mortality populations in 24 countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand (total and non-Maori populations), Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the USA, the UK, and West Germany. Death rates for these populations were available for periods long enough to carry out cohort-based estimations and mortality extrapolations.\n\nOur main scenario for future mortality was based on recent extrapolations that are more optimistic than official forecasts, consistent with the assumption of a linear growth in period life expectancy over the next two decades. Using the same method, we updated the inputs based on more recent HMD releases and reran the projections. In low-mortality countries, we projected the period life expectancy at birth to reach 90 years in 2050, and 28.2 years at age 65. In contrast, the United Nations and Eurostat have projected lower life expectancies for these times.\n\nOur more optimistic results are due to the assumption that better health and lower mortality of current young cohorts will translate into lower mortality during their future old age. The main mortality scenario, although more optimistic than traditional extrapolations, is conservative in assuming that a population\u2019s adult mortality will stop decreasing once the cohort aged 30 in the base year reaches the lifespan limit. Between the base year and that future year, the scenario assumes that the decline in mortality will slow down gradually.\n\nTo investigate the sensitivity of our results to deviations from the main mortality scenario, we developed an alternative scenario based on the traditional procedure of extrapolating declining age-specific mortality rates from past rates. The extrapolations produced a period life expectancy of 85 years in 2050 for low-mortality countries, which is consistent with the projections by the United Nations and Eurostat, and substantially lower than our main scenario. Our alternative scenario gives a period life expectancy of 23 years at age 65 in 2050.\nGiven cohort to produce the size of the cohort at time t. The parameter g in equation (1) affects the age structure in a way similar to that of the classic stable growth rate, r; but it is equivalent to the population growth rate only in the case of constant mortality. In order to avoid confusion, we term g \u2018the growth parameter\u2019. Another contrast with the classic case is that the life expectancy at birth may no longer properly summarize the contributions of the different survival rates to the composition by age of the population. A better summary is the cross-sectional average length of life (Brouard 1986; Guillot 2003):\n\nCAL(t) = \u222b from 0 to 1 l(x; t - x)dx. (2)\n\nWhen mortality is declining, the population is typically younger than the corresponding period life table population, because of the smaller proportions surviving to old age. This effect is well captured by CAL, which is typically shorter than the period life expectancy at birth in the case of declining mortality. In formal derivations and simulations, we follow the standard assumption that the growth parameter remains constant, at least for the period from the year of birth of the oldest retired person to the year of birth of the youngest working-age person. One reason for not breaking with the traditional assumption of constant growth is that its influence on pension systems is currently outweighed by the effect of mortality change in the majority of countries studied. However, we also present estimates based on observed age distributions. These estimates reflect the consequences of observed changes in mortality, fertility, and migration.\n\nDifferential effects of changing mortality on dependency ratios\n\nIn the PAYG pension system, the contribution/benefit ratio is a function of the current population old-age dependency ratio, OADR. In model population (1), this ratio may be written as\n\nPOADR(t) = \u222b from R to e^(-gx)l(x; t - x)dx / \u222b from W to e^(-gx)l(x; t - x)dx (3)\n\nwhere R and W stand for the age groups of those who are retired and working (20-64, and 65 and over, respectively) and POADR stands for \u2018Period OADR\u2019 and applies here only to model population (1). The FS, in contrast to the PAYG system, is based upon birth cohorts, and its contributions and benefits apply over the lifetime of the cohort and are subject to financial risks, the interest rate, and the indexation of wages and pensions. We simplify the analysis of these factors by assuming a risk-free real interest rate, i, where i = iN - iR - ip is the nominal interest rate (iN) net of risk adjustment (iR) and the rate used for pension and wages indexation (ip), which makes allowance for productivity growth and inflation. As in the above case with an assumed constant growth parameter, we assume the real interest rate to be constant, at least for the entire lifetime of the birth cohort currently retiring at age 65. In real terms, the FS contribution/benefit ratio then equals the cohort\u2019s years of life spent in retirement, divided by the cohort\u2019s years of life spent at working ages, all life years being discounted at the real interest rate. This may be expressed as follows, with c referring to birth cohort:\n\nCOADR(c) = \u222b from R to e^(-ix)l(x; c)dx / \u222b from W to e^(-ix)l(x; c)dx (4)\n\nwhere COADR stands for the cohort old-age dependency ratio. We shall be comparing the values of OADR and POADR in year t to values of COADR for the cohort retiring (aged 65) in the same year, that is, setting c = t - 65. The model expressions above extend those proposed by Keyfitz, Arthur and McNicoll, and Bourgeois-Pichat in explicitly allowing for the effects of changing survivorship. With declining mortality, the cohort retiring under the FS will have more survivors who are retired than the current retired population, and it may also have had fewer survivors of working age than birth cohorts who are currently working. Both effects, when i is less than g, contribute to an old-age dependency ratio which is larger for the FS than for the PAYG system. Apparently, the central classic result\u2014the equivalence of the two systems when i is less than g\u2014is incorrect when mortality is changing. Estimates of the dependency ratios based on our mortality data and projections are presented in Table 1. For the PAYG system, values of POADR are presented for growth parameters of 0 and 0.59 percent. The latter value of the growth parameter was so chosen that the resulting POADR, 26.8 percent, would match the corresponding estimated OADR, which is also shown in Table 1. The estimated OADR reflects the effects of both the past changes in the number of births and migration on the age composition of the population. Currently, this effect reduces the OADR by around 5.9 percent (32.7-26.8) compared with the model population with zero growth parameter. The FS is represented in Table 1 by model COADR with a real interest rate of 0 and 1.55 percent per annum. Again, this real interest rate was chosen so that the COADR matched the current observed OADR, that is, 26.8 percent. Since the mid-twentieth century, zero interest rate values of COADR have exceeded zero growth parameters of POADR by about half. Both of them were even higher than the actual OADR that takes into account the effect of changes in the number of births and immigration as well as mortality change. Setting the growth parameter at 0.59 percent and the interest rate at 1.55 percent results in the model POADR and the COADR having values roughly similar to those of the actual OADR. The difference (1 percent) suggests that decreasing mortality is a factor affecting the PAYG internal rate of return, a possibility we consider in Section 6. Interestingly, changing mortality appears to be more important than all other factors combined in influencing the current population age composition. The model POADR at g is smaller, by 15.4 percent (48.1-32.7), than the COADR at comparable i because of the effects of changing mortality on cross-sectional and cohort survival probabilities. Other factors, changes in the number of births, and migration, contribute only 5.9 percent (32.7-26.8), as indicated by the difference between the model POADR and the observed OADR. The relative advantage of the PAYG system attributable to changing mortality is currently at its maximum. The difference between POADR and COADR at zero g and i, respectively, has increased from about 6 percent in the 1950s to 15 percent currently; but it is projected to fall back to about 6 percent by 2060. At g is 0.59 percent and i is 1.55 percent, POADR and COADR are currently equal, but both in the past and the future COADR becomes smaller. The reason for this non-linear change of relative advantage to the PAYG system is the acceleration of mortality decline in the past and our assumption of deceleration in the future.\nCohort-based shifting mortality model, the validity of which has been supported by its application to adult mortality data for developed countries (Ediev 2011a, 2011b, 2012):\n\\( l(x; c) = l(x - kc; 0) \\)\nwhere k is the shift per year in the cohort distributions of ages at death. Essentially, k may be interpreted as the cohort-to-cohort rate of change in life expectancy at birth (around 0.38 years per cohort for cohorts currently in their 60s). Applying this model, the cohort-to-cohort rate of change of the FS retirement age \\(a(c)\\) that yields a constant COADR equals\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dc}a(c) = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\lambda^{-1}_{R}(c)} \\left( \\frac{1}{COADR(c)} -1 \\right) + 1 \\right] \\frac{dCLE(c)}{dc}\n\\]\nwhere \\(CLE(c)\\) is the cohort life expectancy at birth (\\(\\frac{dCLE(c)}{dc}=k\\)); \\(a\\) is the age at entering the workforce; and \\(\\lambda_R(c)\\) is the probability of surviving from age \\(a\\) up to retirement age for cohort \\(c\\).\n\nAt the levels of mortality for cohorts currently in their 60s, and at a 1.55 percent real interest rate, the value of the expression in parentheses in the equation is around 0.5; it is 0.6 at zero real interest rate. Hence, the cohort-to-cohort change of the FS retirement age should be about half the change of the cohort life expectancy in order to secure a constant cohort old-age dependency ratio.\n\nA more practical way of expressing the rate of change of the FS retirement age as a function of the calendar year, \\(a_P(t) = a(t - a_P(t))\\), is obtained from a transformation of the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}a_P(t) = \\frac{d}{dc}a(t - a_P(t))\\left(1 + \\frac{d}{dc}a(t - a_P(t)) \\right)\n\\]\n\nFor the cohorts currently in their 60s, the rate of change of the retirement age is about 0.17 years per year at a 1.55 percent real interest rate, and 0.19 years per year at a zero interest rate.\n\nFor the PAYG system, the change rate of the retirement age \\(A(t)\\) consistent with a constant POADR with shifting cohort mortality is a function of the rate of change of \\(CAL (2)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = \\left[ \\frac{1}{P(a; t)} \\left( \\frac{1}{POADR(t)} - 1 \\right) + 1 \\right] \\frac{dCAL(t)}{dt}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\frac{dCAL(t)}{dt}= \\frac{k}{1+k}\\). In low-mortality countries, the value of the expression in parentheses is currently around 0.7. This results in an annual increase in the PAYG age at retirement of around 0.2 years.\nWith an ageing population, in which the OADR is increasing with time, the DB IRR will tend to be larger than the DC IRR. No real pension system is purely DB or DC, however. An increasing OADR is likely to create pressure to increase contributions, reduce real benefits, and check further increases in the dependency ratio by increasing the age at retirement as well as to allow more entrants into the system. Such changes would shift the actual PAYG IRR to a value in between the two estimates given above. We define an intermediate, more computationally convenient, and perhaps realistic alternative, \u2018the defined-dependency (DD)\u2019 PAYG IRR iDD to supplement the DB and DC estimates of the PAYG IRR. We define it as the real interest rate of the FS that yields, for the currently retiring cohort, a value of COADR equal to that of the current OADR. This definition reflects only the current state of the PAYG system and not the past or future OADR, as do the DB and DC IRRs. It may be interpreted as either of the two conventional PAYG IRRs calculated for a scenario in which the retirement age A(t) is adjusted each period so that the OADR is constant at its current value.\n\nIn the classical case of a stable population, with no mortality change, the PAYG IRR, also known as \u2018the biological interest rate\u2019, equals the stable population growth rate. In our model, the biological interest rate corresponds to the growth rate parameter, g. In practice, the size of the working population is affected both by changing numbers of births and migration. To isolate these effects on population change from that of mortality change, we define \u2018the traditional PAYG IRR\u2019 as the difference between the estimate of the IRR derived from the observed population and the corresponding estimate derived from the model population with g = 0 (the latter estimate reflecting the effect of mortality change only).\n\nEstimates for the three alternative PAYG IRRs are presented in the following table:\n- Defined dependency (DD), defined benefit (DB), and defined contribution (DC) pay-as-you-go internal rates of return, per cent per annum, based on the model actual population age composition for the year 1900-2060.\n\nIncreasing longevity and pension systems play a crucial role in determining the rates. With zero growth parameter, the current DB IRR is approximately 1.86 per cent, the DC IRR around 0.57 per cent, and the DD IRR is about 1.02 per cent. These are the effects of mortality change alone. The combined effect of all forms of demographic change may be seen from the PAYG IRR estimated from the observed values of OADR whenever the available data cover a period long enough to allow the application of relevant equations. Currently, the empirical DD PAYG IRR is around 1.55 per cent (estimates for individual countries vary).\n\nOur main mortality scenario is more optimistic than that applied in any country's official projections. Results for a less optimistic alternative scenario are less pronounced: the contribution of decreasing mortality to DD PAYG IRR falls from 1.0 to 0.7 per cent, and both DB and DC IRRs are also smaller in the main scenario by around 0.3 per cent. Similarly, the ages at retirement necessary to keep the dependency ratios constant are younger under the less optimistic mortality scenario.\n\nGiven the overall similarity in mortality levels and prospects for life expectancy in low-mortality developed countries, our results are applicable to the population of any developed country. However, populations differ more substantially in their age composition, affecting the OADR and, consequently, the corresponding PAYG IRR.\nIn the main scenario by around 0.3 per cent, about 50 years from now, under the traditional mortality projection assumption, dependency ratios in both pension systems will be about 8 per cent smaller than those under the main scenario. Similarly, the ages at retirement necessary to keep the dependency ratios constant at the level of the base year OADR are 2-3 years younger under the less optimistic mortality scenario. In 2060, the DD PAYG IRR is similar in both the main and less optimistic alternative mortality scenarios (0.22 per cent) because both scenarios assume the increase in longevity declines to zero. However, in a truly optimistic scenario with ever-increasing life expectancy, not shown here, we estimate DD PAYG IRR to be more stable and remain at the rather high level of 0.8 per cent by 2060.\n\nCountry-specific results\nGiven the overall similarity in mortality levels and prospects for life expectancy in low-mortality developed countries, the results presented above for the effects of the change in mortality are applicable to the population of any developed country. Populations differ more substantially, however, in their age composition. Results above based on observed values of OADR should therefore be supplemented with those for individual countries (Table 5).\n\nOnly in 9 countries, out of the 24 analyzed, does the traditional PAYG IRR exceed the DD PAYG IRR caused by the mortality decline. In those countries, where the effect of mortality decline is supplemented by higher fertility and immigration, the overall DD PAYG IRR is rather high, and likely to reach, or even exceed, the real interest rate. In Germany and Japan, on the other hand, low fertility and immigration have led to negative traditional IRRs. Yet, even in these two rapidly ageing populations, the DD PAYG IRR is positive, owing to the effect of decreasing mortality.\n\nDiscussion\nWhen the growth parameter and real interest rate are equal, our findings show that the PAYG system has a considerable advantage, owing to the effect of decreasing mortality. The advantage may seem puzzling, because the PAYG system is renowned for benefits payable to the first group of those retiring, who would not be covered at all by a funded system. However, with increasing longevity, workers expect to live longer when they retire than current retirees, and consequently be in a better position to fund others\u2019 current pensions, rather than their own future ones. An insight into this apparent paradox may be gained by considering a scheme with no real interest rate where participants suddenly become immortal. In such a case, the FS would become insolvent for cohorts of immortals at any finite age at retirement, while the PAYG system would still be functional (although with an ever-increasing age at retirement to keep up with the increasing elderly population).\n\nThe PAYG system\u2019s balance is further improved by the net effects of immigration and changing numbers of births, which have so far resulted in a younger population age composition than mortality alone would imply. Their combined effect, however, has been smaller than that of declining mortality ever since the 1950s. Currently, two-thirds of the DD PAYG IRR (1.0 per cent, in real terms, out of 1.55 per cent) may be ascribed to the relative advantage of the PAYG system of increasing longevity. Even in our less optimistic and traditional mortality scenarios, the effect of mortality change currently contributes more than half of the DD PAYG scheme (0.74 out of 1.29 per cent). The effect of decreasing mortality is therefore important; most of the existing models comparing pension systems have ignored this effect and focused on the less important growth parameter.\n\nModifying a conventional PAYG scheme for increasing survivorship may be a more efficient and cost-effective measure than converting the scheme into a partially funded one. Increasing life expectancy, by making IRR exceed the real interest rate for more cohorts of voters, may also contribute to the continuing political acceptability of the PAYG system.\nThe PAYG system's advantage from mortality change is currently estimated to be at its historical maximum. We project this advantage to level off in the long run, but even if mortality eventually stops declining, as in our scenarios, the POADR will only converge to the COADR, and never exceed it. The PAYG IRR, even at g = 0, will monotonically converge to zero without ever becoming negative. In this respect, the differential effect of decreasing mortality on pension systems must not be regarded as a sort of 'pyramid scheme', creating an advantage for contemporary participants in the PAYG system by disadvantaging subsequent generations who are participants in the same system. Also, note that were we to assume a really optimistic scenario with ever-increasing longevity at the current pace of improvement, the PAYG advantage would persist, and the PAYG IRR would remain stable at its currently high level.\n\nAlthough our study was concerned with countries with currently low levels of mortality, effects similar to, or even larger than, those reported here may also be expected in higher mortality countries. Through the process of catching up with the low-mortality countries, those with high mortality may experience a faster decline in mortality, which may be associated with larger differences in the effects between the funded and PAYG pension systems.\n\nOur findings do not suggest that PAYG is necessarily to be preferred over the FS. That conclusion could be drawn only from a much more complex study that took into account economic, behavioral, and political factors. However, our findings do show that one of the key factors relevant to the design of pension schemes has been largely neglected in previous analyses.\nAssuming shift model (5) \\(\\ell(x; c) = \\ell(x - kc; 0)\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{dJ_R(c)}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left(\\int_x a(c) e^{-ix\\ell(x; c)}dx \\right) = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left(\\int_x a(c) e^{-ix\\ell(x - kc; 0)}dx \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n= -a'(c)e^{-ia(c)\\ell(a(c); c)} - k\\int_x a(c) e^{-ix\\ell'_x(x; c)}dx\n\\]\n\\[\n= -a'(c)e^{-ia(c)\\ell(a(c); c)} - ke^{-ix\\ell(x; c)}x_{a(c)}-ik\\int_x a(c) e^{-ix\\ell(x; c)}dx\n\\]\n\\[\n= (k - a'(c))e^{-ia(c)\\ell(a(c); c)} - ikJ_R(c)\n\\]\nSimilarly,\n\\[\n\\frac{dJ_W(c)}{dc} = -(k - a'(c))e^{-ia(c)\\ell(a(c); c)} + ke^{-ial(a; c)} - ikJ_W(c)\n\\]\nSubstituting into (A1):\n\\[\n(k - a'(c))e^{-ia(c)\\ell(a(c); c)} \\left(\\frac{1}{J_R(c)} + \\frac{1}{J_W(c)} \\right) - k\\frac{1}{J_W(c)} e^{-ial(a; c)} = 0\n\\]\nHence,\n\\[\na'(c) = k\\left(1 - \\frac{\\ell(a; c)}{\\ell(a; c)}\\right)[\\text{COADR}(c)]^{-1} + 1 e^{\\left[ia(c)-a\\right]}\n\\]\nwhich leads to equation (6).\n\nA.2.

This study examines the transmission of fertility patterns from parents, grandparents, uncles, and aunts, using event history models to determine the risk of first, second, and third births. Swedish register data are used to study the 1970-82 birth cohorts. The findings indicate strong associations between the fertility of index persons and that of their parents, and also independent associations between the completed fertility of index persons and that of their grandparents and parents\u2019 siblings. The results suggest that, when examining background effects in fertility research, it is relevant to take a multigenerational perspective and to consider the characteristics of extended kin.\n\nKeywords: intergenerational transmission; multigenerational demography; kinship; fertility; grandparents; Sweden\n\nIntroduction\nThe study of the intergenerational transmission of family size from parents to offspring has a long history in demography, but the influence of extended kin remains virtually unexplored. If it exists, the transmission of family size from grandparents and parents\u2019 siblings would constitute a multigenerational transmission of norms and values, and have a persistent structural effect on the size of the extended family, and thus on the number of siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins with whom a person interacts. The purpose of the study presented here was to investigate this form of multigenerational transmission in Sweden.\n\nResearch consistently shows modest, but consistent, effects of the intergenerational transmission of fertility pattern from parents to their children, but the effect of the fertility patterns of other kin members is virtually unexplored. Previous studies involving kinship networks have primarily been concerned with how they have been shaped by changing fertility and mortality patterns. So far, no study has concentrated on the intergenerational transmission of fertility pattern over more than one generation, but it is important to go beyond one generation if one wants to understand and forecast compositional changes over time in traits such as education or ethnicity. Compositional changes also have implications for the size and structure of kinship networks. Identifying strong continuities in fertility pattern across generations might also be important for understanding the social role of kin and which kin may have influence on other traits.\n\nSweden has long-term stable patterns of cohort fertility, high social mobility, and unparalleled longitudinal demographic registers, and together these factors offer favourable conditions for examining multigenerational continuities in fertility. In a study of kinship in Sweden, informants reported comparable, and often larger, kinship networks than had been found by studies in the USA and the UK.\n\nOur study used Swedish administrative register data on the total population for cohorts born between 1970 and 1982. Event history analysis was employed to evaluate the transitions to the first, second, and third births in order to determine how the completed fertility of various kin had affected the fertility of men and women in contemporary Sweden. The specific goals of the study were to establish answers to the following questions about the transmission of fertility pattern in contemporary Sweden: is the fertility of young individuals associated with the completed fertility of their grandparents and their parents\u2019 siblings independently of their parents\u2019 completed fertility? If the association exists, does it differ in strength between men and women, between matrilineal and patrilineal kin, and between female and male extended kin?\n\nAs will be shown below, the results reveal a modest effect of the grandparents and parents\u2019 siblings\u2019 fertility that is independent of the parents\u2019 fertility. A potential explanation of the phenomenon is the size of the kinship network\u2014a consequence of the completed fertility of previous generations\u2014experienced by the individual in the process of socialization. The direct transmission of values from extended kin probably also plays a role.\n\nThe term \u2018kin\u2019 is used throughout the paper to refer to parents, parents\u2019 siblings, and grandparents. The term \u2018extended kin\u2019 is used to refer to parents\u2019 siblings and grandparents. Kin and extended kin were the relatives of members of the study population, which comprised women and men born between 1970 and 1982.\n\nOur study used Swedish administrative register data on the total population for cohorts born between 1970 and 1982. Event history analysis was employed to evaluate the transitions to the first, second, and third births in order to determine how the completed fertility of various kin had affected the fertility of men and women in contemporary Sweden. The specific goals of the study were to establish answers to the following questions about the transmission of fertility pattern in contemporary Sweden: is the fertility of young individuals associated with the completed fertility of their grandparents and their parents\u2019 siblings independently of their parents\u2019 completed fertility? If the association exists, does it differ in strength between men and women, between matrilineal and patrilineal kin, and between female and male extended kin?\n\nThe results reveal a modest effect of the grandparents and parents\u2019 siblings' fertility that is independent of the parents' fertility. A potential explanation of the phenomenon is the size of the kinship network\u2014a consequence of the completed fertility of previous generations\u2014experienced by the individual in the process of socialization. The direct transmission of values from extended kin probably also plays a role.\n\nThe term \u2018kin\u2019 is used throughout the paper to refer to parents, parents\u2019 siblings, and grandparents. The term \u2018extended kin\u2019 is used to refer to parents\u2019 siblings and grandparents. Kin and extended kin were the relatives of members of the study population, which comprised women and men born between 1970 and 1982.\n\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. We start with a discussion of the theoretical perspectives of multigenerational demography, focusing on research on the intergenerational transmission of fertility, multigenerational associations, and kinship and extended families. This is followed by a review of possible pathways of multigenerational associations, an overview of demographic trends in Sweden, and a description of the data and methods used in the study. Finally, the results are presented and discussed.\n\nResearch has shown that, in general, the correlation between generations has become larger in recent decades. Studies of the transmission of fertility in historical periods, before the fertility transition, show mixed results, with some finding evidence of intergenerational transmission and others finding none or very weak transmission. Intergenerational continuity in family size, as measured by Pearson correlation coefficients between the completed fertility of children and that of their parents, generally varies between 0.1 and 0.2 for post-transitional populations, and is somewhat smaller for less developed countries. Continuity in the timing of first birth and marriage seems to be greater. Mother-daughter associations are larger than father-son associations in most studies.\n\nResearchers have suggested several factors that could be associated with the existence and magnitude of the intergenerational transmission of fertility. These include the gender of children and parents, birth order of the younger generation, continuities in lifestyle across the generations, and satisfaction with family of upbringing. Some studies have suggested that childhood satisfaction plays a role. Birth order and continuity in family size have been studied in a wide variety of settings, with mixed results.\n\nThe intergenerational transmission of family size can occur by one or more of the following mechanisms: childhood socialization, continuities in socio-economic status, and genetic factors. Most previous research has assumed that childhood socialization is the principal mechanism. Children growing up in small or large families are socialized into values and norms that they are likely to replicate in their own families. These norms can be directly associated with fertility, such as views on ideal family size or when to form a family, but could also be related to broader cultural, ethnic, and religious patterns that indirectly affect fertility. Another plausible explanation for a continuity in completed fertility is the intergenerational transmission of socio-economic characteristics associated with fertility. Traits like education, occupation, and income have been shown to affect fertility. Many socio-economic characteristics affect the likelihood of having children, and if these characteristics are transmitted between generations, the associated opportunities for or impediments to fertility are transmitted, as well.\n\nPrevious research on intergenerational fertility provides equivocal support for multigenerational continuities in fertility that are independent of associations between the parent-child dyad. Nevertheless, we expected to find continuities in our study and we embodied this expectation in our first hypothesis:\nH1: There is a modest independent association between the fertility of the index generation and that of the completed fertility of grandparents and parental siblings, even after controlling for the completed fertility of the index person\u2019s parents.\n\nBecause research on kinship has repeatedly found that kin relationships are more important to women than men, our second hypothesis was:\nH2: Multigenerational fertility associations are larger for women, female kin, and matrilineally related kin, than for men, male kin, and patrilineally related kin, respectively.\nThat fertility is affected by heritable genetic factors (Kirk et al. 2001; Rodgers et al. 2001) has been argued to be due to the heritability of behavior affecting fertility (such as age of first union or contraceptive use) rather than to the inheritability of fecundity. It is possible that the genetic heritability of other characteristics associated with fertility (such as health, appearance, or socio-economic status) could also be a mechanism. Sociological research on extended kin in developed countries has found consistent evidence that kinship is of more concern to women than to men (Schneider and Cottrell 1975; Rossi and Rossi 1990). The mother-daughter relationship has been described as the strongest tie in the Western kinship system (Young and Willmott 1957; Hagestad 1986). Both men and women report closer ties to their mothers, grandmothers, and maternal kin than to their fathers, grandfathers, and paternal kin. This finding has emerged from studies of frequency of contacts between kin members, kinship and emotional closeness, help from kin to mothers with childrearing, acceptance of normative obligations for the welfare of kin members, and intergenerational transfers. In previous research on closeness to grandparents, people report maternal grandmothers as closer than maternal grandfathers, maternal grandfathers as closer than paternal grandmothers, and paternal grandmothers as closer than paternal grandfathers. Because women live longer and marry younger than men, female and maternal kin are also younger on average and more likely to be alive than male and paternal kin.\n\nIn their examination of the kinship system in the USA in the 1960s and 1970s, Schneider and Cottrell (1975) and Schneider and Smith (1978) found that people had more self-reported female and maternally related kin. Some researchers have shown that bonds between kin of the same sex should be stronger than opposite-sex bonds, but this finding has only weak support from other studies. There has been less research on relationships with parents' siblings than with grandparents, but two studies suggest a similar, female-centred pattern, favouring aunts and matrilineal kin. An evolutionary-oriented literature on parental investment suggests that paternity uncertainty in father-child relationships can explain why paternal kin are less close than maternal kin.\n\nPrevious research on intergenerational fertility provides equivocal support for multigenerational continuities in fertility that are independent of associations between the parent-child dyad. Nevertheless, we expected to find the continuities in our study and we embodied this expectation in our first hypothesis:\n\nH1: There is a modest independent association between the fertility of the index generation and that of the completed fertility of grandparents and parental siblings, even after controlling for the completed fertility of the index person\u2019s parents.\n\nBecause research on kinship has repeatedly found that kin relationships are more important to women than men, our second hypothesis was:\n\nH2: Multigenerational fertility associations are larger for women, female kin, and matrilineally related kin, than for men, male kin, and patrilineally related kin, respectively.\n\nDemographic developments and intergenerational relations in Sweden have shown that most studies of the intergenerational transmission of fertility have had to use measures of relative fertility because of changes in completed fertility between generations. Our study did not have this constraint because Swedish cohort fertility remained almost constant between 1900 and the present despite large fluctuations in period fertility, and thus variation between the completed fertility of generations has been low. Variance in Swedish fertility declined for most of the century but has been increasing modestly for cohorts born after 1950. The mean age at first birth has been relatively stable, becoming slightly younger during the first half of the century but becoming older again after the 1970s.\n\nGeographical and urban-rural differences in fertility occurred historically in Sweden but largely disappeared in the second half of the twentieth century. Education and socio-economic status are associated with older age at first birth in Sweden and, to a much lesser degree, with completed fertility. Studies on the geographical proximity of children and old parents in Sweden have found that men and those with lower educational attainment live closer to their kin than do women and those with higher educational attainment.\n\nSwedish family life is commonly described as being at the forefront of the development toward individualism that is said to be at the core of the Second Demographic Transition. It is a 'welfare state' with high gender equality. Childcare is heavily subsidized by the government. Social mobility is comparatively fluid and the intergenerational persistence of socio-economic status is lower than in most developed countries. A large part of the care of the elderly is provided by state retirement schemes and government care services.\nCompleted fertility for parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles was taken as the total number of children born in Sweden by the end of 2007, as recorded in the register. The number of natural children of the index person\u2019s mother was included as a baseline variable for the fertility of the index person\u2019s parents. The fertility of the father, as a covariate, was also included when the numbers of children of the father and the mother differed. For grandparents\u2019 families, only grandmothers' completed fertility was included in the models. Because union stability was high in Sweden before the 1960s, this was an acceptable approximation of grandfathers\u2019 fertility. To calculate a variable for the family size of parental siblings, four different variables for maternal/paternal aunts and uncles were created. Because subjects can have several (or no) maternal/paternal aunts and uncles, the average number of children within each of these four categories of parental siblings was used (rounded down to the nearest whole integer).\n\nThere are some data issues concerning the creation of digitized population registries in Sweden. The registries were created using administrative data from registers for 1947, when all individuals in Sweden were given a unique personal identity number. Data were collected for both parents and resident children aged under 16 in 1947. Therefore, starting with births in 1932, it is possible to link children to their parents using the 1947 data. For births after 1947, digitized birth records have to be used. For a small number of individuals born in the early 1970s, data on their parents are missing in the registers and they were excluded from the index population. Swedish register data were digitized using data from 1961, so that individuals needed to be registered in Sweden from 1960 onwards in order to be included in the register. Given that the index population was born after 1970, the requirement for the parents to be alive until 1960 was not a problem. For grandparents, the requirement to be alive and registered after 1960 means that information on grandparents and parental siblings are missing from the registers if the grandparent died before 1960. There were also selection issues for the fertility of the parents\u2019 siblings. If a parent was younger than most of his or her siblings, and the parents were born in the 1930s, there was a risk that some siblings had been born before 1932, so that their birth records were therefore missing from the register. This means that the grandparents\u2019 fertility was under-estimated and that some aunts/uncles might have been missing from the data. If the parents' siblings were missing randomly, the true transmission of completed fertility from grandparents would have been underestimated. If an extended family member was missing, the index person was still included, and the variable for kin-completed fertility was replaced by a missing category.\n\nAn overview of the intergenerational transmission of fertility for the index population, using correlation coefficients and other summary statistics is presented in Table 1, which gives the correlation in completed fertility for all categories of kin with that of the index population. The correlations for female index persons are comparable to those of earlier studies, and the smaller correlations for men with kin are most likely to be partly a result of the fact that they had not yet reached their ultimate fertility in 2007. Intergenerational continuity in fertility, as measured by the correlation between the fertility of the index population and that of their parents, is greater than the correlation between the fertility of their parents and that of their grandparents. Correlations between the age at first birth and completed fertility of kin for the 1970 cohort are also included in Table 1.\nTable 1 Correlation (r) between number of children of kin and number of children of index persons, index women, and men born in Sweden 1970, and summary statistics on fertility of kin, Sweden 1970-82 birth cohorts\nEgo\nMother\nFather\nMaternal grandmother\nPaternal grandmother\nMaternal aunt\nPaternal aunt\nMaternal uncle\nPaternal uncle\n\nCorrelation between number of children of kin and number of children of index persons\nWomen*number of children at age 38\n0.12\n0.10\n0.05\n0.04\n0.05\n0.03\n0.02\n0.02\n\nMen*number of children at age 38\n0.05\n0.03\n0.04\n0.03\n0.04\n0.04\n0.04\n0.04\n\nWomen*age at first birth\n-0.17\n-0.14\n-0.10\n-0.10\n-0.05\n-0.05\n0.01\n0.002\n\nMen*age at first birth\n-0.13\n-0.12\n-0.08\n-0.08\n-0.04\n-0.03\n0.012\n0.002\n\nNumber of children of kin (for index persons born 1970-82)\nWomen*mean number of children (SD)\n2.65 (1.06)\n2.69 (1.14)\n3.11 (1.68)\n3.06 (1.68)\n1.97 (1.08)\n1.96 (1.08)\n1.79 (1.17)\n1.83 (1.15)\n\nMen*mean number of children (SD)\n2.60 (1.03)\n2.65 (1.12)\n3.10 (1.76)\n3.00 (1.72)\n1.99 (1.06)\n1.98 (1.09)\n1.82 (1.17)\n1.86 (1.14)\n\nBirth cohorts of kin (for index person born 1970-82)\nMedian\n1976\n1949\n1947\n1921\n1918\n\n25th percentile and\n1973\n1945\n1943\n1917\n1912\n\n75th percentile\n1979\n1950\n1953\n1927\n1924\n\nFull range\n1970-1982\n1932-1968\n1932-1967\n1885-1951\n1885-1948\n\nSource: Swedish register data.\nThe main results are presented for models for the transitions to first, second, and third births for both women and men. All models include identical controls for the following: age; time period (calendar year); educational level; birth order; birth intervals; grandmothers\u2019 birth years; and, as the main explanatory variables, covariates of completed fertility of kin. The tables and figures show estimates of kin covariates only. The results are presented as graphs showing the effect on the transition to first birth and a table giving the main results for all parity progressions.\n\nThe main finding is that, at all parities, the risk of a subsequent birth is considerably and consistently affected by the transmission of parents\u2019 fertility, and is independently associated with grandparents and siblings\u2019 fertility. These results are consistent with the first hypothesis, framed to test the primary research question of the study. The associations are largest for the transitions to first birth, but the pattern is consistent across parities. The mother\u2019s characteristics are the most important for the transition to first birth for both men and women, but there are also independent influences by each of the other categories of kin.\n\nGenerally, the observed relative risk shows a steady increase for each additional child of the kin member concerned. The effect of transmission appears to be slightly stronger when the completed fertility in the previous generation is large.\n\nThe extent of the intergenerational transmission of fertility differs according to the parity of the index generation. The largest association with kin is for the transition to the first birth, while the smallest is for the transition to the second. This is most probably related to the two-child norm in Sweden. Parental leave policy encourages short birth intervals and a uniform pattern of parity progression. For the transition to third birth, the influence of kin size is almost as strong as that for the transition to first birth. Large parental and grandparental family sizes appear to be related to earlier entry into parenthood, and continued childbearing after the second birth. \n\nThere are different patterns by the sex of the index person. Women tend to have greater continuities of fertility with kin than men, but the fertility of men and women is generally equally affected by the completed fertility of different categories of kin. Kin influences show gendered patterns at different parities. For women, completed fertility of kin seems mostly to affect the risk of transition to parity one, with the relative contribution at higher parities being much smaller. Kin influence for men is more equally distributed across the parities and, in addition to that on first birth, kin influences on third birth are considerable.\n\nThe degree of continuity in fertility varies according to type of kin. The fertility of the mother has a large association with the risk of a birth at every parity, and for both sexes. A difference between father and mother in number of children is also associated with the fertility of the index person, though interpretation is difficult, given that such differences tend to be associated with union dissolution. There is a clear, and fairly strong, influence of grandparents\u2019 completed fertility on the risk of a first birth, but the association is evident for every parity. Parents\u2019 siblings\u2019 fertility also has a consistent influence. Overall, the extent of the association with fertility of grandparents and aunts/uncles is similar.\n\nIn general, women\u2019s fertility is influenced more by their grandparents\u2019 fertility, while men\u2019s fertility seems to be equally associated with that of their parents\u2019 siblings and grandparents. Having childless aunts and uncles is negatively associated with becoming a parent, and ambiguously associated with continued childbearing.\n\nWhen studying intergenerational fertility transmission, it is important to distinguish between maternal and paternal kin. There are reasons to believe that, for grandparents, both their direct influence by contact and their indirect influence through the socialization of the parent could differ significantly according to the sex of the parent. The results for kin by lineage show similar influences, though the influence of matrilineal kin is somewhat stronger than that of patrilineal kin. The type of kin shows similar patterns for both maternal and paternal lineages. The fertility of women is more strongly associated with the fertility of maternal than with paternal kin. For men, paternal and maternal kin have similar associations.\n\nThe sex of the parents\u2019 siblings has a larger female kin bias, with the fertility of aunts being more influential than that of uncles. The sex of parents\u2019 siblings seems to be more important than lineage. Maternal aunts have the strongest influence on fertility transmission, followed by paternal aunts, maternal uncles, and paternal uncles. Analogous to the earlier lineage associations, women\u2019s fertility shows slightly larger associations with that of aunts than does men\u2019s fertility, while men\u2019s fertility has similar associations with that of both aunts and uncles. An exception is men and maternal uncles, where there is a strong association. Overall, fertility associations are larger for women, female kin, and matrilineal kin. The results therefore are broadly in line with the second hypothesis, even though in all cases the patterns by sex are rather weak.\n\nPatterns do not seem to vary by birth order of the index person. In separate models by birth order, the extent and pattern of the transmission was largely unaffected. Contrary to earlier findings, first-born children had slightly smaller transmission rates than later-born children. Educational level has a considerable effect on fertility. Covariates of education have a large effect on risk of first, second, and third birth, suggesting that the observed intergenerational transmission is not primarily mediated by intergenerational transmission of education.\n\nTo conclude, the results indicate that the strongest kin influence is on the transition to first birth. There appears to be little impact of kin on the transition to second birth, but there is an influence on the transition to the third. Overall, the influences on completed fertility of all categories of parents\u2019 siblings and grandparents are largely homogeneous. While there are variations by lineage and sex, multigenerational fertility patterns in Sweden appear to be largely symmetrical. Women\u2019s fertility is slightly more influenced by that of kin than men\u2019s. The sex of the kin also has an impact, since the fertility of female kin generally has a somewhat stronger influence. The comparison of lineage effects indicates a larger influence of maternal kin than of paternal kin. Women\u2019s fertility has a large correlation with that of their grandparents, maternal kin, and aunts. Men\u2019s fertility is more equally associated with the completed fertility of all the different types of kin, even if overall patterns are similar to those for women.\nPaternal kin. For men, paternal and maternal kin have similar associations. The sex of the parents\u2019 siblings has a larger female kin bias, with the fertility of aunts being more influential than that of uncles. The sex of parents\u2019 siblings seems to be more important than lineage. Maternal aunts have the strongest influence on fertility transmission, followed by paternal aunts, maternal uncles, and paternal uncles. Analogous to the earlier lineage associations, women\u2019s fertility shows slightly larger associations with that of aunts than does men\u2019s fertility, while men\u2019s fertility has similar associations with that of both aunts and uncles.

Contrary to earlier findings, first-born children had slightly smaller transmission rates than later-born children. Educational level has a considerable effect on fertility. Covariates of education have a large effect on the risk of first, second, and third birth. Covariates of kin fertility remain largely unchanged in models with and without covariates of education, suggesting that the observed intergenerational transmission is not primarily mediated by intergenerational transmission of education.\n\nTo conclude, the results indicate that the strongest kin influence is on the transition to first birth. There appears to be little impact of kin on the transition to second birth, but there is an influence on the transition to the third. Overall, the influences on completed fertility of all categories of parents\u2019 siblings and grandparents are largely homogeneous. While there are variations by lineage and sex, multigenerational fertility patterns in Sweden appear to be largely symmetrical. Women\u2019s fertility is slightly more influenced by that of kin than men\u2019s.

Women\u2019s fertility has a large correlation with that of their grandparents, maternal kin, and aunts. Men\u2019s fertility is more equally associated with the completed fertility of all the different types of kin, even if overall patterns are similar to those for women.\n\nFinally, to estimate the marginal effect of covariates on parents, grandparents, and aunts/uncles\u2019 completed fertility on total fertility for women, parity-conditional fertility tables were used to estimate how the observed changes in hazard rates would affect total fertility at age 37. On average, an index person with a mother who had four to five children, compared to a mother who had two children translates into an increase of 0.38 more own children at age 37. The corresponding increases for grandparents are 0.10 additional children, and, for parents\u2019 siblings, 0.06 additional children.\n\nThe main results of the study indicate an association of fertility across three generations. Parental characteristics have the largest association with the fertility of the index population, but there is also an independent association with fertility of grandparents and parents\u2019 siblings. The influences of extended kin are not very strong, but are consistent and significant, and support the notion of a multigenerational effect on fertility previously overlooked in demography. Holding parents\u2019 family size constant, a positive association has been found between both the grandparents\u2019 number of children and the aunts/uncles\u2019 number of children, and the fertility of the index population.\n\nConclusions\n\nThis research suggests that, when studying fertility, a multigenerational perspective on the transmission process is important. Not only has the transmission of fertility between parents and children traditionally been downplayed, but there is also a multigenerational effect on fertility that has been largely unexplored. The lack of multigenerational research on fertility transmission is probably due to difficulties in finding suitable multigenerational data sets. The recent availability of large administrative registers and digitized historical parish records in different countries has created new opportunities for this type of research.\n\nWe have found evidence of the influence of extended kin on fertility decisions in contemporary Sweden. Our main contribution has been to demonstrate the existence of fertility transmission from grandparents and parents\u2019 siblings that is not mediated through the immediate family of origin. Further, the study offers evidence that the effect is not mediated through education\u2014the societal trait most strongly associated with timing of parenthood in Sweden. These findings highlight the need for more research on multigenerational associations in the social sciences as suggested by others. The association between an individual\u2019s fertility and the completed fertility of extended kin remains significant, even when parents\u2019 fertility is held constant. That finding differs from the results of research in economics and sociology, which found little or no effect of grandparents\u2019 socio-economic traits on their grandchildren\u2019s traits after controlling for the characteristics of parents.\n\nThe data, while rich in demographic information, cannot identify the different pathways that might explain the intergenerational transmission of fertility. One possibility is that the observed continuities are the result of the transmission of cultural values about childbearing in the process of socialization. The family values and traits transmitted across generations could bear directly on childbearing, but might also be related to ethnicity, religion, or other aspects of culture that are associated only in an indirect way with fertility. Another possibility is that continuities in fertility could be a result primarily of resemblance in socio-economic traits. Finally, resemblance in family size could be due to genetic heritability of preferences for children, or a genetic component related to other traits correlated with fertility. Examining the mechanisms that explain intergenerational transmission of fertility remains an important task for future research.\n\nIf the transmission of fertility norms is important in explaining an association in fertility between index persons and their extended kin, two types of socialization might be involved.

Examining the mechanisms that explain intergenerational transmission of fertility remains an important task for future research.\n\nIf the transmission of fertility norms is important in explaining an association in fertility between index persons and their extended kin, two types of socialization might be involved. One type is direct socialization as a consequence of frequent contact. An example is a person who, during the formative years, is in frequent contact with, say, a grandfather and through spending time with him assimilates some of the grandfather\u2019s values about family and childbearing. The fact that support from older kin is positively associated with fertility and that family and social networks are important in fertility decisions provides evidence for this type of influence. The second type of socialization is indirect: an individual adopts the norms and values of those with an extended family as a result of being a member of one. If someone frequently meets a large number of kin of various kinds and the experience is generally positive, one possible consequence is that the individual will internalize norms and values favorable to kinship and family. The advantage of this more structural view of kinship associations is that it helps to explain how multigenerational influences can exist independent of any influence from intermediate generations.\n\nThe findings of larger intergenerational continuities for women and female/maternal kin are consistent with the popular notion that it is women who are primarily responsible for keeping family members in contact with one another in contemporary Sweden. The larger continuities found for women are consistent with the findings of previous research on both the intergenerational transmission of fertility and the effects of extended kin on fertility. Multigenerational associations remain even after taking account of the parents\u2019 characteristics.\n\nMore research is needed to investigate the pathways of intergenerational association found in this study. Research examining the survival status, childhood characteristics, and geographical proximity of kin would be especially helpful. A better understanding of the complex relationships between the intergenerational transmission of other social traits and fertility is also needed. Also important would be research on the extent to which intergenerational continuities in fertility are mediated through union formation and the age at first parenthood of kin. The multigenerational effects that we found in Sweden are modest in size. Perhaps stronger associations would be found in an international study that encompassed more varied multigenerational living arrangements and greater socio-economic continuities.\nSocialization as a consequence of frequent contact is exemplified by a person who, during their formative years, is in frequent contact with a grandfather and assimilates some of the grandfather\u2019s values about family and childbearing.

The advantage of this more structural view of kinship associations is that it helps to explain how multigenerational influences can exist independent of any influence from intermediate generations. The relatively small differences by lineage and sex of kin might indicate that it is actually the number of kin that is influential rather than their characteristics. In other words, the individual\u2019s adoption of preferences for a small or large family may depend primarily on the number of children produced by grandparents, aunts, uncles, parents\u2019 siblings, and cousins, and how this affects frequency of contact with kin. \n\nThe findings of larger intergenerational continuities for women and female/maternal kin are consistent with the popular notion that it is women who are primarily responsible for keeping family members in contact with one another in contemporary Sweden. These larger continuities found for women are consistent with the findings of previous research on both the intergenerational transmission of fertility and the effects of extended kin on fertility. Multigenerational associations remain even after taking account of the parents\u2019 characteristics.\n\nMore research is needed to investigate the pathways of intergenerational association found in this study.
