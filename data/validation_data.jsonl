Hoem\nStockholm University\n\nIn studies of the fertility of migrants in which the data are confined to the migrants only, estimation bias will normally appear in comparisons of childbearing before and after migration. The same issue arises in studies of union formation before and after first birth, marriage formation before and after home purchase, and in any other comparison of behavior before and after an index event if one confines the study only to those who have experienced the index event. It is normally better to avoid analysis of behavior before the index event because such analysis actually conditions on the later arrival of the index event. In this paper, we provide graphical and mathematical representations of this problem and show how one can get a meaningful (unconditional) comparison of behavior before and after the index event provided the data contain enough information for both sub-periods. Otherwise, the analyst should refrain from making a comparison of this nature.\n\nKeywords: parallel processes; migration and childbearing; marriage formation and childbearing; marriage formation and home purchase; marriage formation and criminal behavior; estimation bias produced by conditioning; observational design in event-history analysis\n\nIntroduction\nDemographers often study individual-level processes that develop in parallel and in interaction with each other. These pairs of interacting processes include migration and childbearing, marriage formation and childbearing, union formation and criminal behavior, and marriage formation and home purchase; one can easily think of many more examples. In this paper, we address the analytic danger involved in comparing fertility before and after geographic migration, marriage formation before and after entry into motherhood, and marriage formation before and after the purchase of a home. We also indicate how similar issues arise if the avoidance of criminal behavior is studied in life phases before and after changes in family union status. Conditional before-and-after analyses of this kind can be problematic, for there is a fundamental asymmetry between the analysis for the time before and the analysis for the time after the occurrence of an index event when data are confined to those who experience that event. \n\nHere we use the connection between migration and entry into motherhood as our main vehicle of presentation, and show that the analysis of first childbearing shortly before an observed case of migration will underestimate the fertility of childless migrants in the sending population if the presence of a child hampers out-migration, while in contrast, an assessment of the corresponding rate after migration correctly estimates the fertility of in-migrants in the receiving population (unless some other factor interferes). The intensity estimate for the time before the index event turns out to be biased downwards in this case, but in other cases, the bias is the reverse. For instance, the estimated rate of marriage formation shortly before a home purchase will be biased upward if only homebuyers are considered and if the home-purchase intensity is higher after marriage formation than before it. Only if the transition rates on the second behavior (migration, say) are the same before and after the behavior in focus (childbearing) can one be sure in general that there will be no such bias. Unfortunately, one can rarely know or demonstrate whether a correspondence of this nature is present in the data.\n\nTo handle general issues of this kind, we employ a device that is now standard in several disciplines, and that represents individual behavior as transitions between discrete states in a time-continuous Markov chain, such as the transition from childlessness to motherhood. We have already used the term \u2018intensity\u2019 for a theoretical rate of transition between two such states and thus have a brief and neutral term to denote what in the general theory of event-history analysis is often called the \u2018instantaneous transition rate\u2019 (a cumbersome term) or \u2018hazard\u2019 or \u2018risk\u2019 (which sounds threatening).\n\nStudying the connection between behavior (such as childbearing) before and after an event on a different process (such as migration) involves conditioning on a time of occurrence on the second process. With such conditioning, time is centered on the index event (the geographical move), and the intensity of the other kind of event (childbearing) is estimated for times before and after the index event. Times of occurrence may be counted formally as negative when they occur before the index event and positive when they appear after it, with the time of occurrence of the index event as the origin (zero point) for a conditional pre-and-post-event analysis.\n\nThe specific question we address is how the comparison of childbearing intensities before and after migration, using individual-level data confined to in-migrants, can produce a bias, and what the bias is. The purpose of the paper is to warn against pitfalls involved in analyses of this nature and to note that the possible presence of plans or intentions does not in itself remove biases produced by the conditioning. Of course, planning ahead is part of human nature, but in the absence of reliable individual-level information about intentions, the analyst cannot distinguish between estimation biases and real behavior. We show that one cannot safely disregard the biases in such circumstances as the following: people abstain from childbearing because they plan to migrate; they buy a home because they intend to marry; they marry because they intend to have children; or they change their criminal behavior because they intend to marry. Correspondingly, the intention to have a child after migration does not remove bias in the fertility estimate for periods before migration.\n\nOur paper contributes to the already rich literature on observational design in event-history analysis; see, for instance, Aalen et al. (1980), Courgeau and Leli\u00e8vre (1992, Chapters 5\u20136), Andersen et al. (1993), Blossfeld and Rohwer (2002, Chapter 6), and just recently Keiding (2013). In this tradition, Hoem and Kreyenfeld (2006) may be among the authors who have rejected most explicitly the practice of conditional pre-and-post-event analysis even if one makes assumptions about unmeasured plans and intentions. Here we spell out our reasons in a novel manner and illuminate them with further examples. We add to the design literature by warning against the dangers of conditioning on one behavior in the analysis of another. We are not aware that anyone has addressed these issues in any generality before.\nWe have organized our paper as follows. In Section 2 we use a graphical representation to illuminate the issues we address. In Section 3 we use a collection of concrete situations to describe analytical problems that are likely to appear in a conditional before-and-after analysis. A mathematical representation is presented in Section 4, and Section 5 is a summary of our conclusions.\nTo handle general issues of this kind, we employ a device that is now standard in several disciplines, and that represents individual behaviour as transitions between discrete states in a time-continuous Markov chain, such as the transition from childlessness to motherhood.

We add to the design literature by warning against the dangers of conditioning on one behaviour in the analysis of another. We are not aware that anyone has addressed these issues in any generality before. \n\nWe have organized our paper as follows. In Section 2, we use a graphical representation to illuminate the issues we address. In Section 3, we use a collection of concrete situations to describe analytical problems that are likely to appear in a conditional before-and-after analysis. A mathematical representation is presented in Section 4, and Section 5 is a summary of our conclusions.\nAll individuals are subject to the same set of intensities, which is a simplification. We will consider various alternative specifications as we progress in our account. Before we address that, however, we note that issues of the same kind arise whenever two interacting demographic behaviors or processes are studied in a conditional before-and-after schema. Section 3 contains a number of illuminating illustrations, which we have already mentioned in our introduction.\n\nIssues of the same nature arise in any setting where interacting behaviors are studied.\n\n**3. Illuminating examples**\n\n**3.1. Marriage and first birth**\nReplicating a pattern noted in conditional before-and-after studies, Hoem and Kreyenfeld (2006) showed that conditioning on the time of first birth produces a cusp in marriage intensity around the time of first birth in their German data. However, this is an artifact of the method of analysis, and it disappears, and other patterns appear when childbearing (taken as Process B in our general theory) and marriage formation (Process A) are studied as two interacting processes, each in its own right. Conditioning on one process (B) and studying the other behavior (A), conditional on the first, corresponds to taking Process B to be the cause of Process A in a situation where both processes are probably jointly determined by other features not observed by the analyst, such as the decision process of the individual or the couple. We regard it as better practice, therefore, to study A and B together rather than to condition on one of them and run the risk of distortion.\n\n**3.2. The disruption of childbearing by migration**\nIn the case of migrant fertility, some of the main existing theories revolve around issues of fertility 'disruption'. The fertility disruption hypothesis refers to a temporary discontinuity in childbearing among migrants that has no counterpart for non-migrants. This hypothesis holds that childbearing is likely to be postponed or possibly forgone among migrants in the period just before migration, during the migration process itself, and for some time following migration due to reasons like spousal separation or couples deciding to postpone childbearing while they prepare for migration, settle into the destination society, and find basic housing and employment. This theory further suggests that following temporary fertility disruption, at least some of the postponed fertility may be made up during a period of fertility catch-up. If the purpose of a study is to test the disruption hypothesis, the focus is the fertility of migrants, not the fertility of those who could have migrated but did not. If it is found that the recorded fertility of people who actually migrate is lowered during the period approaching migration and shortly after it, but rebounds some time later, these analysts would see this pattern as consistent with the predictions of the disruption hypothesis.\n\n**3.3. Union formation and home purchase - Intentionality**\nThe literature contains some contributions that advocate the inclusion of (unobserved) plans and intentions, at least for descriptive purposes, which fits with an argument about intentional behavior in house purchasing and in marriage formation. If intentionality is stressed, the post-purchase marriage intensity appears larger than the pre-purchase intensity, and the purchase intensity larger after than before marriage formation. This fits with an argument about intentional behavior in house purchasing and in marriage formation. However, conditioning pre-and-post-event tends to overestimate when the actual sequence of the two processes may depend largely on chance, such as the housing market situation being purely accidental.\n\n**3.4. Family dynamics and criminal activity**\nSimilar issues appear in studies of connections observed between family dynamics and criminal activity. The theory suggests that the criminally inclined reduce their criminal activity to marry or gain a partner and that practicalities of their lives change in favor of fewer offenses once a partner has been found. Observing that the lower offending rates of married people develop over the years before marriage rather than as a consequence of the marriage act, suggestive that the features of the process are not simply binary but spread over periods of courtship and engagement to be married. Analytical challenges are similar to those in other examples where conditioning on one event diverges from another, potentially obscuring genuine behavioral links with biases introduced by methodological frameworks. \n\n**4. General theory**\nWe now turn to the mathematics that covers much of our reasoning. Moving forward, additional generalizations will be required to cover aspects such as those discussed in Section 3.4. We define scenarios and probabilities relating transitions between various states, aiming to account for both observed and unobserved factors affecting the dynamics of interactions and transitions among specified demographic behaviors or processes.\nProcedure described in this paper (Sections 2 and 4). A generalization of our mathematics is needed to cover a richer description of union dynamics and to account for multiple occurrences of the criminal event. Compare Figure 6.2 in the book by Courgeau and Leli\u00e8vre (1992). In fact, taking consensual unions explicitly into account may in itself catch much of the effect that Laub et al. (1998) postulate, though conditioning on the formation of a consensual union creates problems of the same kind as those created by conditioning on a marital union; the problems are caused by the conditioning, not by the type of union. The same issues arise for studies of other connections between family dynamics and criminal behaviour. For example, they appear in a study by Cassan et al. (2000), who find that union dissolution is more frequent during the months preceding imprisonment. Fortunately, at least they carefully refrain from offering any causal interpretation of their findings; in fact, they do not advocate any conclusion as to whether union dissolution increases the probability of committing an offence or whether criminal activity itself is the common cause of both disruption and imprisonment. This is our interpretation of Laurent Toulemon\u2019s translation from the French original in a private communication.\n\nWe now turn to the mathematics that will cover much of our reasoning (although some further generalization will be required to cover such items as those of Section 3.4). For our general argument we let A and B be any two interacting concurrent processes on the individual level. In a Markov-chain formulation the intensities are \u03b10(t) for the A-transition where the event A occurs at a time when B has not occurred, \u03b11(t) for the occurrence of A after B, \u03b20(t) for the occurrence of B at a time when A has not occurred, and \u03b21(t) for the occurrence of B after A has occurred. When the four statuses are numbered from 0 to 3 as indicated in Figure 1, \u03b10(t) is the intensity for the transition from State 0 to 1 at process time t, \u03b11(t) is the intensity for the transition from State 2 to 3 at process time t, \u03b20(t) is the intensity for the transition from State 0 to 2 at process time t, and \u03b21(t) is the corresponding intensity for the transition from State 1 to 3, as indicated in the figure. A proper before-and-after analysis of the A process consists in comparing (an estimate of) \u03b10(t) with (an estimate of) \u03b11(t).\n\nTo pick up the effect of conditioning on an occurrence of Process B in the analysis of Process A, we define a conditional intensity rA(s | t) by the relation. Then rA(s | t), or an approximation to it, is what is estimated by the computations on the positive and negative time axis, as described above, depending on whether s > t or s < t. To correspond with the positive and negative times, we now treat the cases t < s and t > s separately, as follows. \n\nFirst, consider positive occurrence times (s > t). The transitions in Figure 1 that are involved in the numerator in the long fraction above, correspond to the following scenario: Stay in State 0 up to time t, then move to state 2 in the interval t,t + dt), and subsequently stay in State 2 through time s. The corresponding probability is p00(0,t)\u03b20(t)dt p22(t,s), where in each instance pij (x, y) is the probability of moving to State j by time y for someone who is in State i at time x. This gives us an expression for the numerator. A corresponding expression for the denominator consists of the elements in the first row of the scenario, followed by a transition from State 2 to State 3 in the interval (s, s + ds). Therefore, the denominator is p00(0,t)\u03b20(t)dt p22(t,s)\u03b11(s)ds. Dividing out factors common to the numerator and denominator thus gives rA(s | t) = \u03b11(s) when s > t. This shows that the estimand of the procedure used after the index time of occurrence of an event on Process B is the post-B transition intensity for the event A. This mirrors general results for all kinds of counting processes and is normally taken for granted without further reflection. In the migration and childbearing situation it means that, at least as far as the analysis of fertility after in-migration is concerned, it can be carried out with no specific danger of estimation bias, a fact that has been exploited by Andersson (2004), Andersson and Scott (2005), Kulu and Vikat (2007), Kulu and Milewski (2007), Milewski (2008), and innumerable others.\n\nNext, consider the situation when s < t (corresponding to negative occurrence times). Then the transitions from Figure 1 that correspond to the numerator are as follows: Stay in State 0 until time s and then follow one of the following disjoint alternatives: either (i) also stay on in State 0 until time t and then move to State 2 before time t + dt, or (ii) move to State 1 by time t and then move from State 1 to State 3 before time t + dt. The probability of such a scenario is p00(0,s)[p00(s,t)\u03b20(t)dt + p01(s,t)\u03b21(t)dt]. The transitions involved in the denominator are as follows: Stay in State 0 until time s, then move to State 1 by time s + ds, then stay there until time t, and subsequently move to State 3 by time t + dt. The corresponding probability is p00(0,s)\u03b10(s)ds p11(s,t)\u03b21(t)dt. When we combine the latter two formulas and remove factors that cancel, we get rA(s | t) = p11(s,t)\u03b21(t) / (p00(s,t)\u03b20(t) + p01(s,t)\u03b21(t)) \u03b10(s). Therefore, estimating the transition rate for Process A for times before the index occurrence of event B does not provide an unbiased estimator of the pre-B transition rate \u03b10(s) of A, except in special cases (to which we return below). Instead, we get the correct transition rate \u03b10(s) multiplied by a distortion factor uA(s,t) = p11(s,t)\u03b21(t) / (p00(s,t)\u03b20(t) + p01(s,t)\u03b21(t)). For values of s < t close to the time t of occurrence of B, the distortion factor is close to lim s\u2192t uA(s,t) = \u03b21(t) / \u03b20(t), which shows that there is little distortion of \u03b10(s) at negative times close to the index event if the risk of an occurrence of B is largely independent of whether or not A has occurred. Otherwise, one must face the possibility that there can be considerable systematic distortion in the estimates of \u03b10(s) produced for times before the occurrence of the (conditioning) index event on the B process, and one should probably avoid making such estimates. In particular, if \u03b21(t) < \u03b20(t), the computations will underestimate the intensity \u03b10(s) at times just before t.\n\nLet us pursue the idea of non-differential intensities for B, which means that \u03b2i(t) is independent of i, that is, \u03b2i(t) = \u03b2(t) for the same function \u03b2(t) for both values of i. In this case p11(s,t) = exp (\u2212\u222b_t^s \u03b2(u)du) and p0j(s,t) = p0j(s,t) exp (\u2212\u222b_t^s \u03b2(u)du) for j = 0,1 where p0j(s,t) is the value that one will get for p0j(s,t) when \u03b2(t) \u2192 0. (Thus p0j(s,t) is what is sometimes called a partial probability; see Hoem 1969). Therefore, exp (\u2212\u222b_t^s \u03b2(u)du) \u03b2(t) is a common factor in the numerator and denominator of the distortion factor, which means that it cancels and leaves just 1 in the numerator. In the denominator, p00(s,t) = exp (\u2212\u222b_t^s \u03b10(u)du) and p01(s,t) = \u222b_t^s p00(s,u)\u03b10(u)du = 1 \u2212 exp (\u2212\u222b_t^s \u03b10(u)du), so the whole denominator is also identically equal to 1. [In fact, we must have p00(s,t) + p01(s,t) = 1 because from State 0 there is nowhere else to go than to one of the States 0 and 1 between times s and t when \u03b20(t) = \u03b21(t) = 0.] Thus, \u03c6A(s,t) = 1 and there is no distortion when \u03b20(t) = \u03b21(t), that is, when there is no differentiality in the B process. [In statistical terminology going back to a seminal paper by Schweder (1970), B is then said to be locally independent of A. Note that when B is locally independent, the non-distortion result holds and we get no estimation bias before the B event. Establishing whether B is locally independent is normally likely to be a project in itself, however.]\n\nThese arguments carry over to a situation where the intensities depend on a (possibly multidimensional) covariate, say X, which will most probably include individual age (Andersson 2004; Andersson and Scott 2005; Kulu 2006; Kulu and Milewski 2007; Kulu and Vikat 2007; Nedoluzhko and Andersson 2007; Milewski 2008; and many others). In this case, the functions that define the distortion factor will also depend on X and so will the distortion itself, which we can now call \u03c6A(s,t,X). If the (X-dependent) intensities \u03b20(t,X) and \u03b21(t,X) are coinciding functions of X and t (the local-independence case), then \u03c6A(s,t,X) = 1 and there is no estimation bias. If the \u03b2 intensities differ from each other, then there may be a noticeable estimation bias. This covers the case of observed heterogeneity, in that X is taken to represent observed characteristics of the individuals. Alternatively or additionally, the intensities may be subject to unobserved heterogeneity that varies from individual to individual, and that is structured in a manner which makes individuals who have higher childbearing intensities also have lower migration intensities and conversely lets individuals with higher migration intensities also have lower fertility. This structure may be quite plausible and is a different way of obtaining the effect we have sought to cover so far by our specification of the relationships between the basic intensities. (For a particularly clear specification of this nature, see Kulu 2006.) For the analyst confronted with data collected conditionally on the occurrence of a migratory event it is a problem, however, that (as far as we know) all methods that can be used to reveal the existence and effect of unobserved heterogeneity require data both for individuals who migrate and for those who do not. If data are not available for migrants and non-migrants alike, the analyst has no way of determining whether the relations between the fertility observed before and after migration is caused by features of reality or by the method of analysis. This unresolved feature (produced by the presence of heterogeneity) will appear in similar form in all the examples used above to illuminate the problem, and instead of repeating what we have said in each instance we have disregarded both observed and unobserved heterogeneity in the rest of our discussion in this paper.\n\nAs we have noted before, the accounts above contain very simple specifications of the behavior in question. Another way of making them a bit more realistic is to let the post-B intensity for Process A depend on the duration d since the occurrence of B and thus be a function \u03b11(s,d). Similarly, one can let the post-A intensity for B be some function \u03b21(t,d) that depends on the duration d since the occurrence of A, as in work by Kulu (2005) and elsewhere. Duration-dependent intensities make formulas such as those for distortion factors considerably more complex, but the principles remain the same. In fact, estimates of the intensities at times on the positive axis of process time are unbiased while estimates of the intensities at negative process times are biased except in special cases. In particular, A-process estimates are unbiased when the B process is locally independent. In practice, however, it is probably at least as hard to establish such local independence as it is to study the two interacting processes A and B, each in its own right.\nIntensities.

In practice, however, it is probably at least as hard to establish such local independence as it is to study the two interacting processes A and B, each in its own right.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the analysis of two interacting behaviours, it is always best to study all transition intensities involved and to use data that make this possible. In general, this will allow the analyst to compare pre-index-time with post-index-time behaviour without the risk of estimation biases. Otherwise, conditioning on one behaviour in the analysis of another will normally introduce distortions in the analysis unless the process on which the analyst conditions (Process B) has non-differential transition intensities with respect to the behaviour in focus (Process A) [i.e., unless B is locally independent of A]. In practice, the conditional before-and-after type of analysis that is frequently carried out is likely to produce a distortion in the pre-B-event intensity estimate for Process A in most cases and should therefore be avoided. In particular, it is good practice to refrain from trying to study fertility before migration on the basis of data confined to in-migrants or to study any behaviour A before event B only on the basis of those who experience B. Normally the analyst has little control over estimation biases in periods before the conditioning event and cannot safely distinguish between behavioural intentions and these biases. Intentions are best documented (if it can be done at all) from direct observation. If complete data are available, the unbiased procedure is to analyse all transition intensities. Studying each process conditionally on event occurrence in the other (as is sometimes done) cannot be recommended as an alternative to analyzing all intensities in their own right, because a conditional both-ways analysis will simply suffer from estimation biases in both directions."}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "{\n    \"dataset_information\": [],\n    \"study_context\": {\n        \"study_title\": \"The dangers of conditioning on the time of occurrence of one demographic process in the analysis of another\",\n        \"authors\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Jan M.

Child mortality levels have generally declined and converged over the last 30\u201340 years, except for stalls in the 1990s. In contrast, adult mortality in many East and Southern African countries has increased markedly due to the rise in HIV incidence. Recently, adult mortality levels have begun to decline in East Africa, sometimes before the large-scale expansion of antiretroviral therapy programs. Surprisingly, some countries without severe HIV epidemics have not shown sustained improvements in adult survival. We argue that model-based estimates, which infer trends by matching indices of child survival to standard mortality schedules, can be misleading as trends in child and adult mortality do not always evolve in tandem.\n\nKeywords: mortality estimation; sub-Saharan Africa; adult mortality; child mortality; siblings; HIV/AIDS\n\n1. Introduction\n\nTrends in child and adult mortality are crucial indicators of population health progress and are ideally monitored through comprehensive vital registration systems. However, most African countries lack complete national coverage in their vital registration systems. Except for South Africa and, until recently, Zimbabwe, less than 25 percent of deaths are recorded in the official records of mainland sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. As a result, our understanding of health transitions in this region, particularly for adults, largely relies on model life tables (MLTs).\n\nThe United Nations Population Division (UNPD) produces widely used model-based mortality estimates in several steps, including smoothing child mortality trends from survey data and matching these trends to MLTs to estimate background mortality. In countries with significant HIV prevalence, AIDS-related deaths are added, based on epidemiological models. Discrepancies between these model-derived estimates and other sources are addressed by iterative revisions. Continuous refinement ensures consistency with demographic realities and established mortality patterns, but the linkage between child and adult mortality in models can be overly constrained by selected MLTs and assumptions about the HIV epidemic dynamics.\n\n2. Data and Methods\n\n2.1 Estimating Child Mortality\n\nDue to inadequate vital registration data, retrospective reports on child survival from surveys and censuses are employed. Modern censuses in developing countries collect summary birth histories (SBHs), including the total number of children ever born and surviving. Despite indirect mortality estimation methods such as Brass's method being applicable to such data, they require assumptions of steady mortality changes, leading to overly smooth trends. Unlike these indirect methods, we utilize full birth histories (FBHs) from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs), providing detailed data on all births by mother, including survival status and age at death or current age.\n\nThe analysis included 107 DHSs across 36 sub-Saharan countries from 1986 to 2011. Data reformatted for each survey included the number of deaths and exposure time by age, sex, calendar year, and survey timing. Mortality estimates were derived using generalized additive models (GAM), which include smooth functions of covariates. Details on methodology are available in the online supplement.\n\nThe approach allows a precise evaluation of how mortality patterns have evolved, leveraging DHS data's extensive coverage and consistency.\nConsistent both with other components of the prevailing demographic regime and with well-established age patterns of mortality (United Nations 2005), the relationship between child and adult mortality in any particular scenario is, however, constrained by the MLT selected and the assumptions made when reconstructing the course of the HIV epidemic. Here, we present an overview of trends in child and adult mortality in sub-Saharan Africa without resorting to MLTs. Instead, we use birth and sibling histories, collected as part of a number of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs), and adopt comparable methods to obtain each set of estimates. This approach has the significant advantage of allowing us to evaluate how age patterns of mortality have changed over time. After a description of the estimation method used, we present trends in the two mortality indices 5q0 and 45q15. The first index, 5q0, also referred to as \u2018the under-five mortality rate\u2019, indicates the probability, given the mortality regime of the year under consideration, that a newborn will die before reaching its fifth birthday. Similarly, the index 45q15 represents the probability that a person aged 15 will die before reaching his or her sixtieth birthday if faced with the mortality rates prevailing at each age in the year observed. The presentation of the trends is followed by a discussion of changes in age patterns of mortality.\n\nVarious types of retrospective reports on child survival can be used to compensate for a lack of vital registration data. Modern censuses in less developed countries typically collect summary birth histories (SBHs), that is, the number of children ever born to women of reproductive age and the number of those children surviving at the date of the census. From SBHs, indirect estimates of mortality can be obtained using Brass\u2019s method or one of its variants. Although these indirect methods can be applied to DHS data, we did not use them because it is unclear how SBHs should be adjusted to account for the underreporting of deaths. In order to establish a time period to which these estimates refer, a steady and unidirectional change in mortality has to be assumed, resulting in mortality trends which are excessively smoothed.\n\nIn contrast to the methods outlined above, our estimates make use of full birth histories (FBHs), collected by DHSs. Each history is an exhaustive enumeration by the mother of all her children, giving for each the sex, date of birth, survival status, and current age or age at death. Additional questions locate surviving children within the roster of household members and identify multiple births. We used data from 107 DHSs conducted between 1986 and 2011 and covering 36 sub-Saharan countries. Only four countries (Botswana, Mauritania, Eritrea, and Somalia) with populations numbering over 2 million in 2013 were omitted because they had no publicly available DHS data set.\n\nThe DHS data sets were reformatted to obtain the total number of deaths and exposure time for each combination of age, sex, calendar year, and time preceding the survey. The data were pooled within each country and mortality estimates were obtained using a generalized additive model (GAM). GAMs extend generalized linear models by adding a sum of smooth functions of covariates to the linear predictor. The parametric part of the GAM included the child\u2019s age (specified as \u2018less than one\u2019 or \u2018one to four\u2019) interacted with sex. For the 26 countries that had more than one DHS with FBHs, both the age pattern of mortality and any differentials by sex were allowed to change linearly over time. The number of deaths was assumed to follow an over-dispersed Poisson distribution, with the log of exposure time as an offset parameter. Deaths and exposure time occurring more than 22 years before each survey were discarded. Trends in mortality were smoothed using thin-plate regression splines. The degree of smoothing was selected as part of the fitting of the model by minimizing the generalized cross-validation (GCV) score.\nTherapy (ART). It also requires that the level of non-AIDS child mortality be selected somewhat arbitrarily. Plots of estimates of 5q0 for each country with and without the \u2018HIV correction\u2019 are presented in Figure S2 in the online supplement.\n\nEstimating adult mortality since 1988, some DHSs have included a module on maternal mortality that includes a standard set of questions designed to elicit an exhaustive list of all the children born to the interviewee\u2019s mother. The information collected on each member of this \u2018maternal sibling group\u2019 includes birth order, sex, and survival status. Current age is recorded for surviving siblings, while age at death and years since death are collected for those who have died. Additional questions identify sisters who died when pregnant, during childbirth, or within 2 months after the end of a pregnancy or childbirth. In less developed countries, these \u2018sibling histories\u2019 are now a cornerstone of the estimation of maternal and all-cause adult mortality. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD), led by the IHME, made extensive use of sibling histories to estimate mortality rates for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The GBD estimates were derived using a three-stage process: first, a linear model was used to relate measurements of 5q0 and 45q15 to education, lagged gross domestic product per head, and crude death rates attributable to AIDS as estimated by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Second, the residuals from the first stage were smoothed across countries and time. The third stage comprised a Gaussian process regression to combine the data, the sampling and non-sampling variation, and the information from the first two stages to yield final estimates and uncertainty intervals for each country. GBD estimates of adult mortality are not as closely linked to child mortality as is the case for the UNPD estimates, but they are related to a common set of covariates and these covariates are themselves based on extensive modeling. Therefore, while the GBD approach is useful when generating estimates for countries with sparse data, it is not totally adequate when analyzing joint changes in mortality among adults and children. In a study based on 26 DHSs, Timaeus and Jasseh used a more straightforward approach to model adult mortality from DHSs. They pooled all sibling histories in a single Poisson regression, including a standard age pattern, to smooth non-AIDS mortality rates and additional parameters to allow for mortality increases due to AIDS. Only three of the countries included in their study had more than one set of sibling histories. In our study, we used 72 DHSs, covering 34 countries. Deaths and exposure time that predated each survey by 12 years or more were discarded. For 20 of the 34 countries, at least two sets of sibling histories were available. The latter allowed us to fit separate models for each country, using penalized thin-plate regression splines to refine the smoothing of trends. The age pattern of mortality and sex differences were also allowed to change linearly with the duration of each country\u2019s HIV epidemic, starting 4 years after the calendar year in which the UNAIDS HIV prevalence estimate for that nation reached 2 per cent. This 4-year period corresponds approximately to the lag between the development of an HIV epidemic within the general population and the emergence of the resulting changes in adult mortality rates. In cases where only one DHS was available, we used an over-dispersed Poisson regression, assuming a constant rate of change over the 12-year period, and including dummies for age group and sex. Because previous research has shown that respondents tend to underreport deceased siblings, we used an adjustment comparable to that used in the estimation of child mortality discussed above. We pooled all deaths and exposure time for those periods covered by at least two DHSs, and introduced the TIPS as a set of indicator variables in a Poisson regression model controlling for trends and variations in age patterns of mortality. Because the structure of the maternal mortality module in the DHS does not induce interviewers to disproportionately displace or omit recent deaths, the reference TIPS category was set as 1-2 years preceding the survey. As is clear in the lower panel of Figure 1, which shows mortality in the 15-59 age group, the decline in the completeness of death reporting as the interval between death and survey increases is more rapid in this age group than among young children. Compared to the reference period, deaths of males are significantly underreported for periods that precede the survey by 3 years or more. There is also distinct heaping at 10 years before the survey, indicating that respondents had difficulty recalling how many years had passed since a sibling's death. Mortality rates were again adjusted by the reciprocal of the rate ratios. We reiterate that this only corrects for underreporting that is correlated with the TIPS.\n\nTrends in child mortality a summary plot of trends in under-5 mortality by country, within region, is presented for both sexes combined, using a log scale (Figure 2). The geospatial variation in 5q0 for the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s is displayed in Figure 3. Country-specific trends for the years from 1970 to 2010 can be found in Figure S2 in the online supplement. A comparison of Figures 2 and 3 reveals three general trends: (1) child mortality declined in most, but not all, countries between 1970 and 2010; (2) there was a convergence in under-5 mortality rates over this period; and (3) geographical differences in under-5 mortality continue to persist, with the highest levels in West Africa and the lowest levels in East and Southern Africa. Let us first present the general features of these trends, before we describe the exceptions. Under-5 mortality declined from the 1970s to the 2000s in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In the 1970s, more than 20 percent of children died before reaching their fifth birthday in the majority of countries. It was rare to find countries with an under-5 mortality rate below 0.13 and the median rate was close to 0.21. By the mid-2000s, very few countries had an under-5 mortality rate above 0.20 and the median rate was close to 0.14. Even though there had been a marked decline, the latter value was still roughly twice the average rate for South Asia (for 2005) and more than 15 times higher than the rates found in industrialized countries. The declines in 5q0 were most pronounced in West African countries. In contrast, child mortality rates appeared to increase in a handful of Southern African countries. Because West African countries had the highest levels of child mortality in the 1970s, and Southern African countries the lowest, the changes over the three decades resulted in a convergence in the levels of 5q0. This finding is consistent with the trend across the decades preceding those presented here described by Hill. One of the more striking features of the 2000s decade is that Southern African countries no longer stand out as having comparatively low child mortality rates. Before 1985, the countries with 5q0 below 10 percent were those in Southern Africa and Kenya in East Africa. By 2010, populations with low child mortality could be found in all regions. Geographical contrasts persist, however, with a gradient in 5q0 across the continent from northwest to southeast. The landlocked Sahelian countries, such as Mali and Niger, always were and continue to be characterized by some of the highest levels of child mortality in the world. Despite the overall convergence, some aberrations and irregularities are noteworthy. In Southern Africa, the values of 5q0 declined in the 1980s, but increased across the later 1990s and 2000s. In Central Africa, levels of child mortality did not change much between the 1980s and the 2000s. However, only a few surveys were available from which trends could be ascertained and their quality is questionable. Our estimates do not suggest a uniform pattern within Central Africa: child mortality levels remained high in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which recorded a 5q0 of around 0.16 in 2005; they stagnated at a relatively low level in Gabon; in the Congo they seem to have increased from relatively low starting values. Angola is the only country in Central Africa which experienced a relatively rapid decline during the 1990s and 2000s. In West Africa, more surveys per country were available, allowing more reliable trends to be reconstructed. These indicated that child mortality declined substantially in all countries in West Africa during the 1970s. The decline then underwent a temporary slowdown, or even a reversal, in some countries during the 1980s and 1990s before accelerating once more during the 2000s. In East Africa, there was also a rapid decline in child mortality during the 2000s, following three decades of disparate trends: a succession of decreases and increases in Burundi, Kenya, and Rwanda; an increase followed by a decrease in Uganda, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Zambia; and a continuous decrease in Malawi and Ethiopia. The factors underlying these trends are very diverse. Progress in infrastructure and in the provision of health programs contributed to the spread of preventative measures, such as vaccination, and effective treatments reduced the impact of the infectious diseases responsible for most childhood deaths. The introduction of measles vaccine in Africa in the late 1970s and early 1980s, for example, coincided with major reductions in child mortality. Because the latter mortality declines were too large to be explained by the prevention of measles alone, the notion emerged that vaccines may have non-specific effects on the immunity and survival of children more generally. Impressive gains in school enrollment also played an important role in enabling all sections of the population to benefit from the improvement in health services. On the other hand, in some countries socio-political instability, war, and the emergence of new diseases or the re-emergence of old ones, may have acted to counterbalance any positive influences. The factor that immediately springs to mind as adversely affecting child mortality in the decades we studied is the HIV/AIDS epidemic. According to Marston et al., in the absence of other causes of death, only 39 percent of children infected with HIV at birth survive to age 5. Even uninfected\nTrends for the years from 1970 to 2010 can be found in Figure S2 in the online supplement.

Because the latter mortality declines were too large to be explained by the prevention of measles alone, the notion emerged that vaccines may have non-specific effects on the immunity and survival of children more generally (Aaby et al. 1995). Impressive gains in school enrolment also played an important role in enabling all sections of the population to benefit from the improvement in health services. On the other hand, in some countries socio-political instability, war, and the emergence of new diseases or the re-emergence of old ones, may have acted to counterbalance any positive influences.\n\nThe factor that immediately springs to mind as adversely affecting child mortality in the decades we studied is the HIV/AIDS epidemic. According to Marston et al. (2005), in the absence of other causes of death, only 39 per cent of children infected with HIV at birth survive to age 5. Even uninfected children born to seropositive mothers experience excess mortality because their mother\u2019s illness or death may be detrimental to their nutrition and care (Zaba et al. 2005). HIV-driven reversals in the levels of 5q0 occurred in the second half of the 1980s in Kenya and Zambia, in the early 1990s in Zimbabwe, and even later in Namibia and Lesotho. In other countries, where child mortality was still quite high when the epidemic escalated, the impact of HIV/AIDS was often less visible because other factors were operating to reduce mortality. This was probably the case in Malawi, which experienced a continuous decline in child mortality, with only a slight slowdown in the 1980s, despite an HIV/AIDS epidemic of a similar magnitude to that in Zambia.\n\nA second set of factors underlying the mortality reversals that characterize some countries was economic, social, and political turmoil and, in some cases, warfare. For example, the increase in child mortality in Uganda in the 1970s was probably related to the civil war and the collapse of the economy; later it would be exacerbated by the HIV epidemic. The civil war that followed independence in Mozambique also coincided with an increase in child mortality at the end of the 1970s and during the 1980s. The Rwandan genocide of 1994 is clearly visible in the right-hand graph of Figure 2 as a sharp spike in child mortality rates. Because this spike was apparent in the raw rates, we removed the 1993\u201395 period from the GAM and estimated under-5 mortality rates for this period from a simple quasi-Poisson regression, with each of the three years included as a dummy variable.\n\nA slowdown or reversal of child mortality trends in the 1980s and 1990s also occurred in several countries that did not experience explicit economic, social, or political crises. This was the case for several countries in West and Central Africa, such as Burkina Faso, Liberia, Nigeria, and Senegal\u2014none of which had to deal with a severe HIV epidemic either. The decline in child mortality resumed in most of these countries by the end of the 1990s or the early 2000s. Some authors have argued that these slowdowns were due to structural adjustment programmes which imposed reductions in government spending on health and education (Cornia et al. 1987), but there is little evidence to support this claim (Behrman 1988). Other factors may have played a role, as the case of Senegal suggests (Pison et al. 2013). HIV prevalence in Senegal never exceeded 1 per cent among adults (Ndiaye and Ayad 2006; ANSD 2012) and the country benefited from a relatively stable political climate, yet trends in the rate of child mortality were nonetheless irregular. After a rapid decline from the mid-1970s to the end of the 1980s, child mortality rates stalled or, on occasion, increased during the 1990s, but rapidly decreased after the turn of the century.\n\nSenegal\u2019s pattern of child mortality decline resembles that found in many sub-Saharan African countries over the same period, but is unusual in the data sources that exist there for the monitoring of national trends in child mortality. In addition, three rural HDSSs have been in operation in the country for almost 25 years. These closely monitor all vital events occurring in the community under study and each death is usually followed by a \u2018verbal autopsy\u2019 interview in order to determine the underlying cause.\n\nTrends in child mortality observed at the three Senegalese HDSSs, at Bandafassi, Mlomp, and Niakhar, are comparable to those for the country as a whole (Figure S6, online supplement). The decline in child mortality in the 1970s and 1980s at the three HDSSs has been ascribed to a reduction in mortality from infectious diseases, such as measles, as a result of large-scale vaccination campaigns (Desgr\u00e9es du Lo\u00fb et al. 1995; Pison et al. 1995). During the 1990s, however, vaccination coverage reached a plateau and deaths from measles failed to decline further. Another reason for the failure to make progress in the 1990s was malaria. Figure S6 presents trends in the malaria-related mortality rate in children under the age of 5 in Mlomp and Niakhar. Deaths from malaria were identified from verbal autopsy data and by laboratory tests.\nNational trends in child mortality. In addition, three rural HDSSs have been in operation in the country for almost 25 years. These closely monitor all vital events occurring in the community under study and each death is usually followed by a \u2018verbal autopsy\u2019 interview in order to determine the underlying cause. Trends in child mortality observed at the three Senegalese HDSSs, at Bandafassi, Mlomp, and Niakhar, are comparable to those for the country as a whole. The decline in child mortality in the 1970s and 1980s at the three HDSSs has been ascribed to a reduction in mortality from infectious diseases, such as measles, as a result of large-scale vaccination campaigns. During the 1990s, however, vaccination coverage reached a plateau and deaths from measles failed to decline further. Another reason for the failure to make progress in the 1990s was malaria. Deaths from malaria were identified from verbal autopsy data and by laboratory tests in Mlomp. The substantial mortality increase observed during the 1990s was identified as being directly associated with the spread of chloroquine resistance in the malaria parasite.\n\nSimilar patterns were seen at all three HDSSs and help to explain the national-level trends in Senegal. In the 2000s, a renewed commitment to vaccination and increased investments in new anti-malaria programs were among the factors which contributed to a resumption of the decline in Senegal\u2019s child mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, vaccination coverage also increased in the new century, after a decade of stagnation.\n\nTurning now to the comparability of estimates, we find close agreement between our estimates and those developed by the IGME and the IHME for countries which have several DHSs available, such as Benin, Chad, and Liberia. In countries with only one DHS, there is a greater discrepancy between our estimates and those of the IGME and IHME.\n\nAdult mortality trends also show significant patterns. In the majority of sub-Saharan African countries, adult mortality either stagnated or increased over the three decades. The median value of the estimates of adult mortality for males hovered around 0.25 in the mid-1980s but had increased to 0.40 by 2000. By 2007 it had declined again to 0.34. These values were significantly higher than those observed in most West European countries.\n\nThroughout most of the 1990s, the increasing diversity in adult mortality levels was largely driven by the rates of mortality in East and Southern Africa, which saw steep increases highly suggestive of the massive impact of HIV/AIDS. The stabilization of incidence rates is typical of a maturing epidemic, but the declines which followed were probably also the result of certain developments: changes in sexual behaviour, the adoption of risk avoidance strategies such as more careful partner selection, and the expansion of medical interventions including male circumcision and ART.\n\nAdult mortality between ages 15 and 60 peaked around the early 2000s in several East African countries. Our estimates suggest that adult mortality levels in East and Southern Africa are now among the highest on the continent. In Ethiopia and Congo, however, there appears to have been a decrease in adult mortality rates since the early 1990s, though these estimates are tentative.\nThroughout most of the 1990s, increasing regional diversity in adult mortality levels was largely driven by the rates of mortality in East and Southern Africa, which saw steep increases highly suggestive of the massive impact of HIV/AIDS. In several East African countries, the mortality rates had been rising since the mid-1980s, and in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia, 45q15 doubled over the course of the 1990s. A similar, if somewhat lagged, pattern characterizes Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. The geography of the surge in adult mortality rates echoes earlier patterns of HIV incidence. Incidence rates peaked in the early 1990s in East Africa, and in the mid to late 1990s in Southern Africa, before declining. The stabilization of incidence rates is typical of a maturing epidemic, but the declines which followed were probably also the result of three particular developments: changes in sexual behaviour; the adoption of risk avoidance strategies such as more careful partner selection; and, more recently, the expansion of medical interventions including male circumcision and ART. Interestingly, adult mortality rates in East Africa had already peaked before ART was delivered to any significant proportion of the infected population. It is estimated that only 2 per cent of the total population in need of treatment were receiving ART in 2003 in sub-Saharan Africa. ART coverage rates increased to 12 per cent in 2005 and 30 per cent in 2007. Adult mortality between ages 15 and 60 peaked in 2000 in Malawi, in 2001 in Uganda, in 2002 in Zambia, and in 2003 in Namibia and Kenya. Our estimates suggest that Malawi, Kenya, and Tanzania had some of the lowest adult mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1980s. As a direct result of the severe HIV epidemics in East and Southern Africa, however, adult mortality levels in these regions are now among the highest on the continent. The most positive story from East Africa, if not sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, comes from Ethiopia where 45q15 slowly increased during the early 1990s, but after the figure for men peaked at 0.45, it is estimated that it fell by 40 per cent over the next 15 years. Congo, in Central Africa, also appears to have experienced a sustained decline in adult mortality since the mid-1990s, but the level from which the rates began to decline was relatively high and, as is the case for most other Central African countries, the estimates for Congo are based on just one survey and must therefore be considered no more than tentative. Adult mortality trends in East and Southern Africa are not surprising given the magnitude of the HIV epidemic in these regions. More puzzling is the fact that few, if any, countries in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa registered sustained adult mortality declines in the three decades studied. Although there were modest gains in adult survival in the Sahel in the 1980s, most West and Central African countries experienced either stagnating or increasing mortality levels after 1990. In a few West African countries where mortality increases were most explicit, they can be attributed to AIDS mortality, as in Cameroon and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, or to the consequences, both direct and indirect, of political instability and civil strife as was the case in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Rwanda. The spike in adult mortality in Rwanda in 1994, was the direct result of civil war and genocide. Trends in the other West and Central African countries are less easily explained without detailed analysis of changes in the causes of death but, unfortunately, the necessary data are scarce. It is almost certain, however, that high, and possibly increasing, mortality rates from non-communicable diseases and external injuries would play a role in any explanation offered for the lack of sustained improvements in adult survival in West Africa and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. A recent review highlights considerable heterogeneity in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer), but a common concern is that many of these conditions often go undiagnosed and untreated, resulting in a mortality rate that is higher than necessary.\nElsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, there is considerable heterogeneity in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Many of these conditions often go undiagnosed and untreated, resulting in a mortality rate that is higher than necessary. Populations, particularly in Southern Africa, now face the double or even triple burden of high mortality rates from infectious diseases, chronic conditions, and injuries.\n\nThere are several implications for mortality measurement from comparing levels and trends in adult mortality estimated from different sources. DHS sibling histories yielded mortality estimates that were lower than those calculated by UNPD, especially for West African countries not severely affected by HIV. This discrepancy may be due to a relatively large downward bias in the reporting of mortality in siblings in West Africa compared to East and Southern Africa. Larger family sizes and a higher incidence of polygyny in West Africa could contribute to disproportionate omissions of siblings. Another implication is that trends in adult mortality can differ depending on the sources used, which is particularly an issue in countries not heavily affected by HIV, such as Guinea and Burkina Faso. Trends captured by sibling survival histories are more reliable even though the levels estimated may be too low. Estimates of mortality of men and women derived from survival reported in sibling histories tend to produce larger differences between the sexes than found in UNPD estimates, particularly in countries severely affected by HIV. Our estimation approach allowed for the sex differences in mortality to change over time in countries like C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, and Uganda, where the mortality disadvantage of men appears to increase over time. These discrepancies could point to flaws in the HIV prevalence data from UNAIDS factored into UNPD estimates.\n\nOverall, our estimates of adult mortality are in line with, though slightly lower than, those developed by IHME. The IHME uses additional, complementary data sources, including data on recent household deaths, which may inflate their figures above ours.\n\nBy applying the estimation methods described to different but comparable data sources, changes in the mortality of adults and children can be analyzed side by side. Estimates indicate that in countries without widespread epidemics, declines in child mortality may not correspond with declines in adult mortality, as observed in Senegal, or vice versa, as in Niger pre-1990.\n\nIt is evident that sub-Saharan Africa will fall far behind several of the targets of the Millennium Development Goals set in 2000. Despite some improvements in child survival in countries like Madagascar and Liberia, only a few sub-Saharan countries are on track to achieve the goal of reducing their 1990 under-5 mortality rate by 67 percent by 2015. Adult mortality trends in sub-Saharan Africa have largely been disconnected from trends in child mortality, especially from the late 1980s. In only a few countries, such as Madagascar, Senegal, and Ethiopia, have trends in adult mortality even approximately followed the path of prevailing under-5 mortality rates.\n\nThe conjunction of increasing convergence of national childhood mortality rates with growing divergence in adult mortality rates over the last two decades has been a striking feature of the demography of sub-Saharan Africa. Estimates developed by the UN capture the marked heterogeneity of adult mortality rates but not its full extent. This disparity provides an impetus for more extensive use of empirical estimates of adult mortality, with the UNPD starting to use the two-parameter Brass logit model for some West African countries.\n\nRatios stem from the underestimation of adult mortality from data on siblings; it is unlikely that child mortality rates were overestimated. It is difficult to establish whether the underestimation of adult mortality is limited to surveys conducted in West Africa or whether it affects all DHSs, since most countries in other regions of the continent experienced severe HIV epidemics, and these tend to distort the relationship between adult and child mortality. Even in West Africa, the distortion can be seen in the mortality estimates for Cameroon, between 1986 and 2003, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire from 1982\u20132004.\n\nThe path of adult-to-child mortality ratios shown in Figure 6 differs between three groups of countries in East and Southern Africa. In the first, the data from Ethiopia for the period from 1988 to 2009 and from Madagascar between 1980 and 2007 are in line with the series of HMD rates, and in reasonable agreement with, respectively, the North and West MLTs. In the second, trends for Kenya, Tanzania, and Malawi, as well as Zambia and Uganda (not shown in Figure 6), follow a horseshoe-shaped pattern, where declines in child mortality coincide with increases and then decreases in adult mortality. In the final group, the three Southern African countries show a quite distinct pattern. At first, in both Zimbabwe and Namibia, child mortality declines while adult mortality stagnates. Both countries then experience significant increases in the risks of dying during adulthood while child mortality stagnates in Namibia and increases in Zimbabwe. Rates in Lesotho follow a similar trajectory, although the levels of child mortality are somewhat higher. Probably as a result of the later peak in HIV incidence in Southern Africa, the populations in this region fail to show declines in adult mortality rates similar to those observed in much of East Africa.\n\nIt is evident that sub-Saharan Africa will fall far behind several of the targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set in 2000. One of the most prominent MDGs calls for countries to reduce their 1990 under-5 mortality rate by 67 percent by 2015. Despite impressive improvements in child survival in such countries as Madagascar and Liberia, only a few sub-Saharan countries are currently on track to achieve that goal. Their lack of progress is partly explained by the stagnation of child mortality rates during the late 1980s and the 1990s. Evidence from Senegal indicates that setbacks cannot be attributed to the impact of the HIV epidemic alone. Declines in rates of immunization and increases in malaria-related mortality, owing to the emergence of chloroquine-resistant strains of the parasite causing the disease, also played a major role. More encouraging is the recent accelerated decline in under-5 mortality in several countries, including Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, and Senegal. Renewed efforts to increase the distribution of vaccines are undoubtedly amongst the driving forces behind this acceleration, together with the expansion of programs distributing bed-nets treated with insecticide, the progress in the provision of vitamin A supplements, and the rapid spread of measures to prevent the transmission of HIV from mothers to their children.\n\nAdult mortality trends in sub-Saharan Africa have followed trajectories that have largely been disconnected from trends in child mortality, at least from the late 1980s onwards. In only a handful of countries, such as Madagascar, Senegal, and Ethiopia, have trends in 45q15 even approximately followed the path of the prevailing under-5 mortality rates. In other countries, adult mortality has either stagnated, sometimes at relatively high levels, as in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burkina Faso, or has risen dramatically since the 1990s. AIDS mortality dominates many of the all-cause mortality patterns, but the first indications of a decline in adult mortality have emerged in East Africa, in some instances in advance of the large-scale expansion of ART programs in 2005.\nFeeney, G. 2001.

This paper seeks to assess the relationship between educational attainment and the incidence of marital disruption by systematizing the existing empirical evidence. A quantitative literature review (a meta-analysis) was conducted to investigate the temporal change in the relationship, net of inter-study differences. The results point to a weakening of the positive educational gradient in marital disruption over time and even to a reversal in the direction of this gradient in some countries. The findings also show that the change in the educational gradient can be linked to an increase in access to divorce. Finally, the results suggest that women\u2019s empowerment has played an important role in changing the educational gradient, while the liberalization of divorce laws has not.\n\nKeywords: marital disruption; education; socio-economic status; meta-analysis; marriage; social change\n\nIntroduction\n\nEurope has witnessed a substantial increase in the incidence of marital disruption in recent decades. This increase has been greatest in Nordic countries, followed by Western and Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The rates are lowest in the Mediterranean countries of Europe, but even there the increase in marital disruption has accelerated over the past decade.\n\nA substantial body of research has been conducted in response to these developments, with the goal of learning more about the correlates, if not the determinants, of marital disruption. One of the most important subjects of research has been the role of women\u2019s education. This factor has attracted considerable attention, in part because it is a valid surrogate for hard-to-measure concepts like opportunity costs, but also because it is a marker of individual autonomy, intellectual abilities, and free-thinking. Yet despite the acknowledged importance of women\u2019s education, there is considerable controversy about the educational gradient in marital instability, that is, whether the relationship between education level and the incidence of marital disruption is positive or negative. The economic theory formulated by Becker predicted that highly educated women would be more likely to disrupt their marriages, because they tend to gain less from role specialization within a couple and to be more economically independent of their spouses than their less educated counterparts. Others have argued, however, that the greater earning potential of highly educated women has stabilized marriages in modern societies. Recently, scholars have emphasized the role of contextual factors in shaping the relationship between women\u2019s educational attainment and marital stability. Specifically, it has been suggested that with the eradication of the economic, legal, and social barriers to divorce, together with changes in the social and economic roles of women, there has been a weakening in the positive educational gradient in marital disruption, or even a reversal.\n\nEmpirical studies have given inconsistent results on how women\u2019s educational attainment affects marital stability. While some studies have shown that highly educated women are more likely than less educated women to divorce, other studies have yielded contrary results. Only a few researchers have considered the effects of the contextual factors mentioned above on the educational gradient of marital disruption. The most comprehensive contribution to this debate was made by H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen and Dronkers, who analysed cross-country and temporal variations in marital stability by comparing several marriage cohorts in 17 countries using data from the Fertility and Family Survey (FFS). They found cross-country variation in the association between women\u2019s educational attainment and marital disruption, and provided evidence of a temporal shift towards a more negative educational gradient in marital instability in nine countries. They also demonstrated that this shift was mainly driven by social changes towards more unconventional family behaviours (cohabitation, non-marital childbearing, and marital disruption).\n\nThe purpose of the study reported here was to explore further the educational gradient in marital disruption, and investigate the factors responsible for its variation over time and space. To do this we undertook a meta-analysis of published research on the impact of women\u2019s educational attainment on marital disruption in Europe. With this method, it was possible to take advantage of the abundance of empirical findings obtained using various data sets and a wide variety of research methods. The crucial advantage of a meta-analysis over a single comparative study is the greater statistical power of its estimates and the generality of its findings, even though each component study is specific to a particular set of circumstances and based on certain assumptions. Thus, this paper contributes to knowledge about the educational gradient in marital disruption in European countries by providing an integration and systematization of the quantitative findings of existing comparative studies, thereby making it possible to generalize about their findings.\n\nHoem et al. (1992), Poortman and Kalmijn (2002), and De Rose and Di Cesare (2007) present one set of findings; however, other studies have yielded contrary results (e.g., Trussell et al. (1992), Berrington and Diamond (1999), Boyle et al. (2008)). Only a few researchers have considered the effects of the contextual factors mentioned above on the educational gradient of marital disruption (Blossfeld et al. 1995; Hoem 1997; Chan and Halpin 2002; Salvini and Vignoli 2011). The most comprehensive contribution to this debate was made by H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen and Dronkers (2006), who analyzed cross-country and temporal variations in marital stability by comparing several marriage cohorts in 17 countries using data from the Fertility and Family Survey (FFS).

To do this, we undertook a meta-analysis of published research on the impact of women\u2019s educational attainment on marital disruption in Europe. With this method, it was possible to take advantage of the abundance of empirical findings obtained using various data sets and a wide variety of research methods. The crucial advantage of a meta-analysis over a single comparative study is the greater statistical power of its estimates and the generality of its findings, even though each component study is specific to a particular set of circumstances and based on certain assumptions (e.g., Shadish et al. 2002; Konstantopoulos 2006). Thus, this paper contributes to knowledge about the educational gradient in marital disruption in European countries by providing an integration and systematization of the quantitative findings of existing comparative studies, thereby making it possible to generalize about their findings.\n\nThe conceptual approach most commonly used in studies of marital disruption views divorce as a choice made by an individual after he or she has considered the utility of marriage against available alternatives (being single or being with another partner). If the individual determines that an alternative provides greater utility, the marriage is dissolved. The utility of marriage is multi-dimensional and covers emotional gains, gains related to the specialization of partners in paid and unpaid work (Becker 1981), as well as gains related to joint consumption and the pooling of resources (Oppenheimer 1994; Sigle-Rushton 2010). The type of gains derived from marriage may differ, depending on the wife\u2019s education. On the one hand, well-educated women have lower relative gains from specializing in housework than less-educated women because they have better opportunities in the labor market (Becker 1981). On the other hand, education increases some gains from marriage. First, it improves the economic gains because a highly educated woman has a greater ability to provide income, which may reduce marital strains by improving the couple\u2019s living standards and diversifying the risk of a job loss (Hoem 1997; Jalovaara 2003). Second, it also increases the emotional benefits of marriage because education may contribute positively to a woman\u2019s communication skills and her ability to resolve marital conflict, making her more attractive as a marriage partner and raising the partners' personal satisfaction from the marriage (e.g., Amato 1996).\n\nThe potential divorcee must weigh the putative gains from staying married with those that appear to be offered by the alternatives of being single or with another partner. Among the considerations to be taken into account are the costs of terminating the current marriage. These costs include divorce-related legal expenses, time spent dealing with legal proceedings, and psychological costs resulting from the social stigma of marital disruption. Overall, educated women are better able to deal with the costs of marital disruption. They tend to be better equipped intellectually to understand complex divorce laws and to have a network of friends and acquaintances who might be able to help them through the process (Hoem and Hoem 1992). In addition, they are more likely to be able to cover the financial costs related to marital disruption (Aassve et al. 2007). Finally, they may have more liberal values and may therefore be less concerned about social norms (Blossfeld et al. 1995).\n\nIt is noteworthy that educational differences in the gains from marriage and the costs of marital disruption also depend on the social context of marriage (Blossfeld et al. 1995; Hoem 1997; H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen and Dronkers 2006; Kaplan and Stier 2010). Recent research has shown that, in modern societies, where it is common for women to work outside the home and contribute to household income, the gains from specialization are becoming less important than the gains from income pooling (Cherlin 2000; Poortman and Kalmijn 2002; Jalovaara 2003; Raz-Yurovich 2012). This change may improve the stability of marriages, especially for highly educated women, whose earnings may form a much greater contribution to the household budget than those of less educated women. The effect of this change may be reinforced by an increase in the emotional gains from marriage since similarities in economic activities and interests have been shown to be more decisive for the durability of a union than gains from specialization (Simpson and England 1981; Coltrane 2000; Sayer and Bianchi 2000; Wilcox and Nock 2006). The costs of marital disruption have also been found to vary with the social context of marriage. When the costs are high, access to divorce or separation for less educated women is restricted because they are less well equipped with the intellectual and economic resources needed for a divorce than are more educated women (Goode 1962, 1970, 1993). However, divorce or separation becomes more affordable for less educated women as the social acceptability of divorce increases, the economic activity of women becomes more common across social strata, and the legal procedures become less complicated and less costly.\n\nThus, overall it might be expected that the modernization of society\u2014which has led to a decline in the gains from specialization and an increase in the other gains from marriage, as well as to a decrease in the cultural and economic costs of marital disruption, and the legal costs of divorce or formal separation\u2014would weaken, if not reverse, the positive association between higher education and greater marital disruption. The rise in women\u2019s employment may have played a crucial role in weakening that educational gradient, for at least two reasons. First, the increasing participation of women in paid employment reflects a decline in the gains from specialization in marriage relative to the gains from income pooling. Second, the rise in women\u2019s labor force participation improves the chances of the less educated finding paid employment, thus eliminating part of the economic barrier to dissolving an unhappy marriage. The other factor that may have contributed to a change in the educational gradient is the introduction of legal reforms that have made divorce easier. Research findings have shown that the liberalization of divorce laws leads to an increase in divorce rates, although the extent of this growth seems to depend on the stage of the liberalization process. It has been found that being able to obtain a divorce without the consent of the other partner has a significant impact on divorce rates (Friedberg 1998; Gonz\u00e1lez and Viitanen 2009), but because this is usually allowed before its introduction as a legal right, the latter usually has no effect (Kneip and Bauer 2009). The liberalization of divorce laws may have made divorce easier, particularly for the less educated, as easier divorce procedures are less costly and less difficult to understand.\n\nThe theoretical framework outlined above led to the formulation of the following three-stage strategy of testing hypotheses about the temporal change in the educational gradient of divorce and the factors that contribute to it. The first stage involved testing whether the available evidence confirms that there has been a weakening of the positive educational gradient over time (H1), as suggested by the changes in the distribution of gains from marriage by educational status and the weakening of barriers to dissolving unhappy marriages. The second stage entailed verifying whether the change in the educational gradient can be attributed to an increase in access to divorce (H2). In the third stage, the issue investigated was whether the weakening of the positive educational gradient can be linked to a change in the economic position of women in society, reflected in an increase in the participation of women in the labor force (H3). This final stage also comprised an exploration of whether the positive educational gradient becomes weaker with a liberalization of divorce laws (H4).\n\nMeta-analysis has increasingly been employed in the social sciences (Vemer et al. 1989; Amato and Keith 1991; Twenge et al. 2003; Waldforf and Pillsung 2005; Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer 2005; Wagner and Weiss 2006; Proulx et al. 2007; Matysiak and Vignoli 2008; Jose et al. 2010). This form of analysis was developed to synthesize, combine, and interpret research evidence from different studies of the same topic. The method offers a clear and systematic way of comparing the results of different studies, standardized for inter-study differences. To start with, all research papers on the topic of interest are reviewed and those that satisfy specified criteria of comparability are selected for the meta-analysis. Next, the estimated coefficients from each study are recalculated in a standardized way to give comparable indicators (known as effect sizes) of the magnitude of the association between each independent variable of interest and the dependent variable. Finally, these effect sizes are combined into single summary indicators. If the computed indicators are very heterogeneous, regression techniques are applied to account for inter-study differences.\n\nA crucial step in carrying out a meta-analysis is defining the set of research studies to be reviewed (Lipsey and Wilson 2001, p. 16). In that process, researchers must balance the desire to collect the widest possible range of studies against considerations of comparability and focus. Although a meta-analysis should have the most comprehensive selection possible of studies on the topic of interest, the studies should also fall within a well-defined range and should not be too heterogeneous (Blettner et al. 1999). In the meta-study presented here, the main focus was on the studies that followed women from a given point in a union (most often its formation) until its disruption (through separation or divorce), or until the end of the observation period. These studies made use of panel or retrospective data, and applied statistical methods that accounted for the duration of the analyzed process, as well as for the sequence of analyzed events. Although the primary purpose of the meta-study was to investigate the effects of women's educational attainment on marital stability, also included in the analysis were the results of studies that had encompassed consensual unions and marriages in a single model; marriages constituted the vast majority of unions in these studies. Studies that focused solely on non-marital unions were not included in the meta-analysis. Finally, the meta-study was restricted to studies in European countries because they display an interesting variation in divorce patterns and women's roles, while also sharing certain economic, social, and cultural characteristics that minimize the heterogeneity of the research findings and facilitate their interpretation. Limiting the study to Europe had the practical advantage that macro-level indicators describing the social context of marriage were available for all countries.\n\nReferences to papers reporting appropriate studies were identified by a search of Web of Knowledge (WoK), an international research database. Next, references reported in these papers were checked and experts were asked for recommendations. Published research based on European analyses was included up to 2010. The search of WoK was performed over 2 months, starting from the middle of September 2010. To ensure that the collection included a representative sample of high-quality studies, only published papers and chapters in books and monographs were considered; working papers and internal research reports were disregarded. The search was conducted using a combination of selected general keywords (\u2018divorce\u2019 OR \u2018union dissolution\u2019 OR \u2018union disruption\u2019 OR \u2018union breakdown\u2019 OR \u2018marital instability\u2019 OR \u2018marital stability\u2019 OR \u2018marriage stability\u2019 OR \u2018marriage instability\u2019). The search was stopped when, after the different keywords had been combined and new ones added, only papers already selected were obtained. Only papers in English, German, Italian, and Polish were considered in the first stage. In the second stage, several European experts in divorce research were asked for their recommendations of publications not identified by our search. The omission of studies published in other languages may have led to an under-representation of some countries in the analysis. This is a common problem in literature reviews. On the other hand, no studies of this kind were found in the literature sources consulted.\n\nUsing this search strategy, 74 potentially suitable studies were identified. Nine of these were eliminated because they included men and women in a single model, with no specific control for women\u2019s education. A further twelve studies were excluded for reasons of incomparability. For example, in nine German studies the highest educational level category did not distinguish between levels of education above passing the final exam at the end of higher secondary school (Abitur). Three more studies were dropped because educational level, as defined, could not be used for the meta-study; either it was included as a variable in a pooled sample of several countries or with levels that were not explained. After the exclusions 53 studies remained, of which 15 were specifically devoted to testing the effect of women\u2019s education on the risk of marital disruption.\nA form of analysis was developed in order to synthesize, combine, and interpret research evidence from different studies of the same topic. The method offers a clear and systematic way of comparing the results of different studies, standardized for inter-study differences. To start with, all research papers on the topic of interest are reviewed and those that satisfy specified criteria of comparability are selected for the meta-analysis. Next, the estimated coefficients from each study are recalculated in a standardized way to give comparable indicators (known as effect sizes) of the magnitude of the association between each independent variable of interest and the dependent variable. Finally, these effect sizes are combined into single summary indicators. If the computed indicators are very heterogeneous, regression techniques are applied in order to account for inter-study differences.\n\nA crucial step in carrying out a meta-analysis is defining the set of research studies to be reviewed. In that process, researchers must balance the desire to collect the widest possible range of studies against considerations of comparability and focus. Although a meta-analysis should include the most comprehensive selection possible of studies on the topic of interest, the studies should also fall within a well-defined range and not be too heterogeneous. In the meta-study presented here, the main focus was on studies that followed women from a given point in a union (most often its formation) until its disruption (through separation or divorce), or until the end of the observation period. These studies made use of panel or retrospective data, and applied statistical methods that accounted for the duration of the analyzed process, as well as for the sequence of analyzed events.\n\nAlthough the primary purpose of the meta-study was to investigate the effects of women\u2019s educational attainment on marital stability, also included in the analysis were the results of studies that had encompassed consensual unions and marriages in a single model; marriages constituted the vast majority of unions in these studies. Studies that focused solely on non-marital unions were not included in the meta-analysis. Finally, the meta-study was restricted to studies in European countries because they display an interesting variation in divorce patterns and women\u2019s roles, while also sharing certain economic, social, and cultural characteristics that minimize the heterogeneity of the research findings and facilitate their interpretation. Limiting the study to Europe had the practical advantage that macro-level indicators describing the social context of marriage were available for all countries.\nVariable was also taken into account in the meta-regression.\n\nA second problem was the lack of standard errors or other statistics which would have made it possible to calculate standard errors (e.g., t-statistics or at least p-values). Following the literature on meta-analysis, the following assumptions were made. When the result was marked significant and no other details were available, the p-value was set equal to 0.05. When the result was not significant and when the upper limit was 0.05, the p-value was set at 0.55. When the significance was marked with stars only, it was assumed that the p-value was equal to the midpoint of its interval.\n\nIn the first stage, a descriptive analysis of the effect sizes was conducted. Even at this early stage, an attempt was made to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the educational gradient in marital disruption. The question of whether the gradient had undergone any temporal changes was also investigated. For the purposes of descriptive analyses, the European countries were grouped into four clusters: Nordic countries, Continental European countries and the UK, CEE countries, and Southern Europe. These four country groups differ in family regime and level of women\u2019s labour supply.\n\nThe effect sizes were tested for homogeneity using the homogeneity test proposed by Hedges and Olkin (1985). The test confirmed the expectation that there would be a large variation in the estimated effect sizes. The source of the variation lay in the differences in the social context of marriage, as well as in the particular characteristics of the original studies, including differences in the measurement of educational level. Therefore, in the second stage, a series of meta-regressions were performed. In this case, \u03b8i from formula (1) is expressed as \u03b8i = X\u03b2+\u03b7i where \u03b7i ~ N(0, \u03c42) and X represents the set of considered regressors.\n\nThe major explanatory covariate in the meta-regressions was the midpoint of the calendar period covered by the study. A series of variables was introduced into the meta-regression to describe the characteristics of the original studies, variables that could have affected the estimation of educational differences in divorce risk. These were: (1) sample design (i.e., birth cohorts, marital cohorts, and observation over a certain period of time); (2) union type covered by the study (focus on marriages only, versus all unions); (3) method (discrete or continuous event history analysis); (4) control covariates used in original studies (i.e., educational homogamy, child-related factors, including the ages, number, and sex of any children, as well as whether the children were conceived, or born, before marriage; the socio-economic status of the woman, including her economic activity and income; and the perception of justice and fairness in the gender division of unpaid work); and (5) the measurement of the educational level (continuous or categorical measurement; inclusion of lower secondary education into the low education category; a woman\u2019s education introduced as part of a combined category with her partner\u2019s). All but two characteristics of the original studies appeared to be insignificant. The two significant covariates were the union type covered by the study and the introduction of a woman\u2019s education in interaction with her partner\u2019s. Only these two covariates were retained in the final models.\n\nIn the meta-study, it was considered desirable to control for whether the researchers in the original studies accounted for selection into marriage. A failure to take this issue into consideration might have affected the effect sizes, since women differ in their marriage propensity with respect to educational attainment. Unfortunately, because only two studies were found that considered selectivity into marriage based on education, it was not possible to account for this factor in our meta-regression.\n\nAccording to the study by Bernardi and Mart\u00ednez-Pastor, self-selection of highly educated women into marriage does not bias the estimate of the effect of women\u2019s education on marital disruption.\n\nThus, the basic meta-regression contained calendar period, union type, and the control for educational measurement (interaction of a woman\u2019s education with her partner\u2019s). This model was estimated in order to investigate the hypothesis about the weakening of the positive educational gradient with time. In the next stage, the model was extended with certain contextual indicators to address the remaining research hypotheses. Because these indicators were strongly correlated with one another, they were introduced into separate models in order to avoid problems of multi-collinearity.\n\nFirst, the total divorce rate (TDR) was added to the basic model in order to test the hypothesis, which proposed that the weakening of the educational gradient was linked to the improved access to divorce. Because this indicator reflects the intensity of divorce, it captures legal, normative, and behavioral changes. It was introduced into the model as a computed average over the time period of the study.\n\nSecond, the hypothesis about the link between the change in the educational gradient and the increase in women\u2019s economic and social independence was addressed. As for the TDR, the average values of women\u2019s labour force participation rates over the time period of the study were computed and added to the basic model. Finally, the hypothesis about the link between the weakening of the positive educational gradient and the liberalization of divorce laws was investigated. For this purpose, a set of variables was introduced into the basic models that captured the proportion of time covered by the study during which a particular divorce law was in force. This model was estimated for effect sizes that referred to marriage only.\n\nThe robustness of the meta-regression estimates was verified in a set of sensitivity tests. The meta-regressions were estimated a further four independent times, with particular observations being omitted from the meta-sample each time. In the first stage, data for Sweden were dropped. It was therefore possible to confirm that the findings were not driven by patterns in the data observed in a country that dominated in the meta-sample. In the second stage, the effect sizes from the study which contained a large number of estimates and which showed a reversal in the educational gradient of marital disruption, were removed. In the third stage, the studies which originally measured a woman\u2019s educational attainment as number of years spent in education, or which interacted with her husband\u2019s educational level, were eliminated. This made it possible to test the robustness of the findings to the way educational attainment had been measured in the original studies. Finally, the meta-sample was randomly reduced by 10 percent. The outcomes of these sensitivity tests are available upon request. The results largely correspond to the estimates from the models estimated on the full sample, which supports the robustness of the meta-findings.\n\nDescriptive findings\n\nThe effect sizes are presented in Figures 1\u20134. Each figure displays effect sizes for a different country group, and within each country group, the effect sizes are ordered according to the midpoint of the time period analyzed in the original study.\n\nThe process of family destabilization and deinstitutionalization in Europe is most pronounced in the Nordic countries. This region has had the highest divorce rates on the continent since the early 1960s. Currently, around half of marriages in Nordic Europe end in divorce. The Nordic countries are the part of the continent where the liberalization of divorce laws had proceeded the most quickly, and where de jure unilateral divorce laws were first introduced. This country group also stands out in Europe for the high labor force participation of its women, which is supported by public policies and is socially accepted. The shift towards an egalitarian division of labor took place in this part of Europe relatively early. Given the theoretical premises outlined above, it might be expected that the legal, economic, and social costs of marital disruption, as well as the gains from specialization, would be relatively low in Nordic countries, while the gains from income pooling and the emotional gains would be high. Consistent with this expectation, the meta-results indicate that the average effect of education on marital disruption for all collected studies for the Nordic countries is significantly negative.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the effect was positive in the past and only changed its sign with time. This temporal change in the sign of the effect size was observed for the whole group of countries, as well as for individual countries within it, such as Sweden, Norway, and Finland.\n\nIn contrast to the Nordic countries, in the countries of Mediterranean Europe the shift towards the process of deinstitutionalization and destabilization of families had been less pronounced, and this country group displays a relatively low incidence of new family-related behaviors, such as marital disruption, cohabitation, or out-of-wedlock childbearing and childrearing. Divorce rates in Southern Europe in the early 2000s were still below 200 per 1,000, which is one of the lowest rates on the continent. It is also notable that divorce was not allowed in this part of Europe until relatively recently: Italy and Portugal did not allow divorce until the 1970s, and divorce was not possible in Spain until the early 1980s. Southern European countries are also known for the relatively low rates of women who participate in the labor force and a relatively traditional division of household labor. Thus, it might be expected that the legal, economic, and social costs of marital disruption in this part of Europe would be relatively high, and that the gains from income pooling would be relatively low. Given this context, it is not surprising that, in contrast to the Nordic countries, the average effect of education on marital disruption for all studies for Southern Europe is significantly positive.\nThe gains from income pooling and the emotional gains would be high. Consistent with this expectation, the meta-results indicate that the average effect of education on marital disruption for all collected studies for the Nordic countries is significantly negative. However, it should be noted that the effect was positive in the past and only changed its sign with time. This temporal change in the sign of the effect size was observed for the whole group of countries, as well as for individual countries within it, such as Sweden, Norway, and Finland.\n\nIn contrast to the Nordic countries, in the countries of Mediterranean Europe the shift towards the process of de-institutionalization and de-stabilization of families had been less pronounced, and this country group displays a relatively low incidence of new family-related behaviours, such as marital disruption, cohabitation, or out-of-wedlock childbearing and childrearing. Divorce rates in Southern Europe in the early 2000s were still below 200 per 1,000, which is one of the lowest rates on the continent. It is also notable that divorce was not allowed in this part of Europe until relatively recently: Italy and Portugal did not allow divorce until the 1970s, and divorce was not possible in Spain until the early 1980s. Southern European countries are also known for the relatively low rates of women who participate in the labour force and a relatively traditional division of household labour. Thus, it might be expected that the legal, economic, and social costs of marital disruption in this part of Europe would be relatively high, and that the gains from income pooling would be relatively low. Given this context, it is not surprising that, in contrast to the Nordic countries, the overall effect size in Mediterranean Europe was significantly positive.\n\nNevertheless, a temporal change in the educational gradient of marital disruption has also been observed in this group of countries. The findings clearly illustrate that the positive educational gradient in marital disruption has been gradually weakening, and the effect came close to becoming statistically insignificant in recent studies. As in the Nordic countries, the temporal change was visible not only in the whole country cluster, but also in individual countries, such as Italy and Spain.\n\nContinental Europe and the UK are similar to Nordic Europe in the extent of marital disruption, although divorce rates in this group of countries seem to be slightly more heterogeneous. At the beginning of the 2000s, their TDRs ranged between 0.37 (France and the Netherlands) and 0.54 (Belgium). The divorce laws are not as liberal in these countries as in Nordic countries, but they are not as strict as in the Mediterranean countries. Continental European countries also occupy an intermediate position between the Nordic countries and those of Southern Europe in the levels of women\u2019s labour force participation, public and social support for working parents, and gender equality. Nevertheless, strong heterogeneity exists, with Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and the UK displaying higher levels of economic activity among women, better welfare support for combining work and family, and greater acceptance of women participating in the economy, than in Austria or Germany. To conclude, the legal, economic, and social costs of marital disruption, as well as the gains from specialization in this part of Europe might be expected to be lower than in Southern Europe and higher than in the Nordic countries. Consistent with this expectation, the overall effect size in Continental Europe and the UK was found to be close to zero, a value that lies between those observed for the Nordic and the Mediterranean countries. In addition, in this country cluster some signs of a temporal change in the educational gradient in marital disruption were apparent, although they were much weaker than in Southern or Nordic Europe.\n\nFinally, the last country group comprises CEE countries. This cluster of countries displays the highest variation in marital disruption; the average TDR is around 0.35. However, rates in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and almost all of the post-Soviet countries exceed this average, reaching levels observed in Northern or Western Europe; whereas in Poland or Romania, marital disruption is below average. In addition, a characteristic feature of the countries of CEE is the widespread acceptance of women\u2019s economic roles, coupled with a traditional perception of women as the main care providers. In these countries, women have been relatively active in the labour force for several decades, even though welfare support for working parents deteriorated in the early 1990s. On average, this country group could be expected to display relatively high gains from income pooling, as well as moderate social, economic, and legal costs of marital disruption, but with these costs varying considerably from country to country. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect any temporal pattern in the effect size, since the studies for these countries did not differ in the periods covered. Except for two studies for Russia, all the others were analyzed using FFS data, and mostly covered the period from the 1960s until the early 1990s, though there was some slight variation in the starting and end points of the observation periods caused by differences in the timing of the FFS fieldwork. The only conclusion that can be made at this point is that no significant educational differences in risks of marital disruption were found across the countries of CEE during the post-war period.\nThe highest variation in marital disruption occurs in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), with average Total Divorce Rates (TDR) around 0.35. However, Czech Republic, Hungary, and nearly all post-Soviet nations exceed this average, matching levels typically seen in Northern or Western Europe; whereas countries like Poland and Romania exhibit below-average marital disruption rates. A distinguishing trait of CEE countries is the extensive acceptance of women\u2019s economic roles alongside their traditional view as primary caregivers. Women in these regions have been active in the labor force for decades, even as welfare support for working parents deteriorated in the early 1990s. Generally, this group of countries might demonstrate relatively high benefits from income pooling, alongside moderate social, economic, and legal costs of marital disruption, although these costs vary significantly across countries. Unfortunately, no consistent temporal pattern in effect size was discernable through the studies which did not vary over time. The only discernable factor was that no substantial educational differences in risks of marital disruption were identified across the CEE during the post-war period.\n\nThe relationship between access to divorce and educational gradients in marital dissolution is also noteworthy. The total (period) divorce rate (TDR) was introduced in the base model to inspect its effect on the educational gradient of marital disruption. Subsequent models considering only marriages show a significant negative impact of TDR on the educational gradient, indicating that increased access to divorce likely contributes to the weakening of the once positive gradient of marital disruption. This change supports the hypothesis that increased divorce accessibility contributes to the observed temporal decline in the educational gradient.\n\nThese findings are coherent with descriptive analyses and meta-models that suggest a reduction in the positive educational gradient in marital disruption over time, particularly in regions where barriers to divorce are lower and female labor force participation is higher and more accepted.\nThe model is consistent with the descriptive findings on the differences in effect sizes across country groups, yielding the smallest educational gradient for the Nordic countries and the largest for the Southern European countries. Overall, the descriptive analyses in Figures 1\u20134 and the meta-models M1\u2013M2 provide clear support for hypothesis H1 on the weakening of the positive educational gradient in marital disruption over time. They also suggest that the gradient is less positive, or even negative, in those regions of Europe where the barriers to disrupting a marriage are weaker, and where the labor force participation of women is greater and more socially accepted. In the following sections of the paper, the role of women\u2019s participation in the labor force and the liberalization of divorce laws in the change in educational gradient are tested in greater depth.\n\nAccess to divorce was measured using the total (period) divorce rate (TDR). In the first stage, the TDR was introduced into the basic model M1, followed by a model for studies that analyzed only marriages, excluding those that investigated union disruption in general. The meta-models M3a and M3b indicate a large and significantly negative effect of TDR on the effect size, suggesting that better access to divorce is linked to a weakening of the educational gradient of marital disruption. Furthermore, controlling for TDR, the analysis shows that the effect of calendar year becomes insignificant, fully accounting for the temporal decline in the educational gradient.\n\nWomen\u2019s social and economic independence is the next area of focus. The decline in the educational gradient in marital disruption may be partly due to the increasing economic and social independence of women, as measured by the participation rate of women in the labor force. Irrespective of the focus of the original studies, findings show that women\u2019s labor force participation is negatively correlated with the educational gradient of marriage disruption. This result supports hypothesis H3. The introduction of the participation rate of women in the labor force into the model leads to a smaller coefficient for the temporal change in the educational gradient, although the effect of calendar year on effect size remains significant. This suggests that an increase in the participation of women in the labor force only partly explains the temporal decline in the educational gradient.\n\nFinally, we address hypothesis H4, proposing that the decline in the educational gradient in marital disruption could be linked to a weakening in the legal barriers to ending a marriage. This hypothesis was tested with a meta-sample of studies that investigated the disruption of marital unions only. According to the results, neither the introduction of divorce based on mutual consent nor the implementation of de jure unilateral divorce is significantly correlated with the educational gradient in marital disruption. The introduction of these legal variables into the model does not affect the coefficient for the effect of calendar year on educational gradient, providing no support for hypothesis H4.\n\nThe relationship between educational attainment and marital dissolution has attracted considerable attention among researchers. The meta-analysis reported in this paper was undertaken to remedy the lack of generalized findings, as micro-level studies often focused on one country or issue. The results are robust to the type of data and analytical methods employed in the original studies. Despite limitations due to data constraints, this research implies a reversal in the formerly positive educational gradient in marital disruption. It appears closely associated with the changes in the structure of gains from marriage brought about by factors such as an increase in the participation of women in the labor market and an eradication of the barriers to disrupting a marriage. This may eventually lead the positive educational gradient of marital disruption to decline, vanish, or even reverse in all the European countries where marital instability is currently increasing substantially.\nDisruption is associated with an increase in the participation of women in the labour force, the driving force of the change is not clear. It could be linked to an increase in the earning power of highly educated women and the pooling of resources, or an increase in the economic independence of less educated women. The relative importance of these factors would be an interesting subject for future research. Despite these limitations, the major implication of this research is that a reversal has occurred in the formerly positive educational gradient in marital disruption, and that it has been closely associated with the change in the structure of gains from marriage brought about by two factors: an increase in the participation of women in the labour market and an eradication of the barriers to disrupting a marriage. Thus, the change from the positive relationship between women\u2019s educational attainment and divorce risk (which has yet to occur in some countries) is a consequence of the changes in women\u2019s economic and social roles, together with the changes in the material and social costs of divorce yielded by increases in educational attainment. Once the idea that women can be income providers becomes more socially accepted, women\u2019s earnings start to form an important contribution to the household budget, and the material and social costs of marital disruption begin to fade. It is a noteworthy finding that unions formed by highly educated women are not necessarily less stable than those formed by less educated women. This may be for one or more of the following reasons: they tend to have a better position in the marriage market before marriage; they are less exposed to the strains imposed by shortage of money; and they are often better able to resolve interpersonal conflicts. In fact, rising levels of marital stability among couples with high socio-economic status are already being observed (Esping-Andersen 2009; Bernardi and Mart\u00ednez-Pastor 2011; Salvini and Vignoli 2011). On the basis of our findings, it is plausible to predict that, over time, the positive educational gradient of marital disruption will decline, vanish, or even reverse from positive to negative in all the European countries where marital instability is currently increasing substantially.\nEsping-Andersen, G\u00f8sta. 2009.
