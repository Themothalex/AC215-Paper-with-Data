Paper with Data

**Project**

In this project, we aim create a dataset-centered search portal. This portal will enable researchers to use fine-grained dataset catefories and filter papers not just based on the presence of datasets, but also on the nature of their relationships. The core of our project is to construct a database of summarise of dataset from which we can get the most relevant papers to the query by users. We first use Gemini to construct a database and then use RAG to facilitate the searching process.

### Milestone4 ###

In this milestone, we have the components for frontend, API service, also components from previous milestones for data management, including versioning, as well as language models.

After completions of building a robust ML Pipeline in our previous milestone we have built a backend api service and frontend app. This will be our user-facing application that ties together the various components built in previous milestones.

**Application Design**

Before we start implementing the app we built a detailed design document outlining the applicationâ€™s architecture. We built a Solution Architecture and Technical Architecture to ensure all our components work together.

Here is our Solution Architecture:

**Backend API**

We built backend api service using fast API to expose model functionality to the frontend. We also added apis that will help the frontend display some key information about the model and data.

**Frontend**

A user friendly React app was built to search the most relevant papers from our database of structured summaries of papers. The app will be much more accurate in terms of paper searching as it has fine-grained information in the database unlike traditional search engines that only rely on titles and abstract.

Here are some screenshots of our app:
