When pension systems are contrasted, it is common to use simplified demographic models, such as overlapping generation models with time-invariant mortality. Breaking with this tradition, we show that for a population with increasing longevity, the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system may be more advantageous than a funded system (FS). Increasing longevity favours the PAYG system because for the workers living longer at retirement than current retirees, it is less costly to fund others' current pensions than their own. At present, the effect amounts to around 15 percent in terms of the dependency ratio, six more years at work in the FS, or 1 percent per annum in terms of the real interest rate. In most developed countries, the effect substantially exceeds that of the usually studied biological interest rate.

1. Introduction
In developed countries, populations are ageing due to increasing longevity and, in many instances, low fertility. This has put the solvency of pension systems at risk, despite the counterbalancing effect of immigration. The severity of the problem has been exacerbated by three factors: the inability of countries to meet the European Council's Lisbon targets for adult employment by 2010; public resistance to recent attempts to delay retirement; and growing antipathy to immigration. To address this, attention has shifted to the possibilities of structural reform of existing pension systems. Of particular interest has been the idea of shifting from the PAYG system, in which pensions are financed by contributions from those currently in the labour force, to a combination with the funded system (FS), where pensions are paid from accumulated savings. It is assumed that different pension systems respond differently to demographic developments, particularly that the FS system is not as directly affected by the changing population age composition as the PAYG system.

Population Studies analyses have thoroughly explored the role of demographic change in applied studies of particular pension schemes, including simulations of their solvency and usually employing carefully prepared population projections. However, comparisons of alternative pension designs often rely on simplified demographic models that assume constant mortality. These simplifications may be a response to the complexity of the issue, which requires a comprehensive treatment that considers economic, political, behavioural, and social factors as well as purely demographic ones.

Recently, Settergren and Mikula emphasized the importance of increasing longevity as a factor favouring the PAYG system and partially accounted for changing mortality by supplementing Aaron's equation for the PAYG rate of return with the effect of change in turnover duration. As life expectancy increases, so does the turnover duration, thereby improving the PAYG internal rate of return.

2. Data and mortality scenarios
We used mortality data from the Human Mortality Database and our own forecasts averaged over the low-mortality populations in 24 countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, and others. We projected the period life expectancy at birth to reach 90 years in 2050, and 28.2 years at age 65 in our main scenario, based on recent extrapolations that are more optimistic than official forecasts. These projections are consistent with linear growth in period life expectancy over the next two decades.

An alternative scenario was developed based on the traditional procedure of extrapolating declining age-specific mortality rates. This produced a period life expectancy of 85 years in 2050 for low-mortality countries, which is consistent with projections by the United Nations and Eurostat and substantially lower than our main scenario.

Our study compared the effects of changing mortality on PAYG and FS schemes and their implications for the dependency ratio, age at retirement, and rate of return. We also specified some basic ageing indicators for situations of changing mortality and derived some analytical results, providing a comprehensive analysis of how increasing longevity impacts pension systems.
The same also applies to more recent analyses and discussion (Willis 1988; Lee 1994; Sinn 2000; Galasso and Profeta 2002; Bommier and Lee 2003; Lee and Mason 2011). Recently, Settergren and Mikula (2005) stressed the importance of increasing longevity as a factor favoring the PAYG system and did partially take changing mortality into account. They did so by supplementing Aaron’s equation for the PAYG rate of return by the effect of change in turnover duration (the difference between the contribution-or-benefit-weighted mean ages of retiree and contributor). As life expectancy increases, so does the turnover duration, which, in turn, improves the PAYG internal rate of return. However, their base model assumes a stable population, which is only possible after mortality has stayed constant for a long period; the effects of demographic change are estimated as the difference between two different stable population scenarios. Bommier and Lee (2003) also considered changing mortality in their general conditions for balancing pension systems, but did not investigate the effects in their model.

In the study presented here, we compared the effect of changing mortality on PAYG and FS schemes and its implications for dependency ratio, age at retirement, and the rate of return. We also specified some basic aging indicators for situations of changing mortality, and derived some analytical results. Assuming realistic mortality scenarios for developed countries, we contrasted the effect of increasing longevity with that of other drivers of population aging.

The paper is structured as follows: Data and scenarios are described in Section 2; the effects of changing mortality on old-age dependency ratios are presented in Section 3; the results for age at retirement and the rates of return in Sections 4 and 5; and a sensitivity analysis, using an alternative scenario for future mortality in Section 6. Finally, results for individual countries are given and discussed. The Appendix contains derivations of the equations in the text.

We used mortality data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD 2012) and our own forecasts averaged over the low-mortality populations in 24 countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand (total and non-Maori populations), Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the USA, the UK, and West Germany. Death rates for these populations were available for periods long enough to carry out cohort-based estimations and mortality extrapolations.

Our main scenario for future mortality was based on recent extrapolations that are more optimistic than official forecasts, consistent with the assumption of a linear growth in period life expectancy over the next two decades. Using the same method, we updated the inputs based on more recent HMD releases and reran the projections. In low-mortality countries, we projected the period life expectancy at birth to reach 90 years in 2050, and 28.2 years at age 65. In contrast, the United Nations and Eurostat have projected lower life expectancies for these times.

Our more optimistic results are due to the assumption that better health and lower mortality of current young cohorts will translate into lower mortality during their future old age. The main mortality scenario, although more optimistic than traditional extrapolations, is conservative in assuming that a population’s adult mortality will stop decreasing once the cohort aged 30 in the base year reaches the lifespan limit. Between the base year and that future year, the scenario assumes that the decline in mortality will slow down gradually.

To investigate the sensitivity of our results to deviations from the main mortality scenario, we developed an alternative scenario based on the traditional procedure of extrapolating declining age-specific mortality rates from past rates. The extrapolations produced a period life expectancy of 85 years in 2050 for low-mortality countries, which is consistent with the projections by the United Nations and Eurostat, and substantially lower than our main scenario. Our alternative scenario gives a period life expectancy of 23 years at age 65 in 2050.
Given cohort to produce the size of the cohort at time t. The parameter g in equation (1) affects the age structure in a way similar to that of the classic stable growth rate, r; but it is equivalent to the population growth rate only in the case of constant mortality. In order to avoid confusion, we term g ‘the growth parameter’. Another contrast with the classic case is that the life expectancy at birth may no longer properly summarize the contributions of the different survival rates to the composition by age of the population. A better summary is the cross-sectional average length of life (Brouard 1986; Guillot 2003):

CAL(t) = ∫ from 0 to 1 l(x; t - x)dx. (2)

When mortality is declining, the population is typically younger than the corresponding period life table population, because of the smaller proportions surviving to old age. This effect is well captured by CAL, which is typically shorter than the period life expectancy at birth in the case of declining mortality. In formal derivations and simulations, we follow the standard assumption that the growth parameter remains constant, at least for the period from the year of birth of the oldest retired person to the year of birth of the youngest working-age person. One reason for not breaking with the traditional assumption of constant growth is that its influence on pension systems is currently outweighed by the effect of mortality change in the majority of countries studied. However, we also present estimates based on observed age distributions. These estimates reflect the consequences of observed changes in mortality, fertility, and migration.

Differential effects of changing mortality on dependency ratios

In the PAYG pension system, the contribution/benefit ratio is a function of the current population old-age dependency ratio, OADR. In model population (1), this ratio may be written as

POADR(t) = ∫ from R to e^(-gx)l(x; t - x)dx / ∫ from W to e^(-gx)l(x; t - x)dx (3)

where R and W stand for the age groups of those who are retired and working (20-64, and 65 and over, respectively) and POADR stands for ‘Period OADR’ and applies here only to model population (1). The FS, in contrast to the PAYG system, is based upon birth cohorts, and its contributions and benefits apply over the lifetime of the cohort and are subject to financial risks, the interest rate, and the indexation of wages and pensions. We simplify the analysis of these factors by assuming a risk-free real interest rate, i, where i = iN - iR - ip is the nominal interest rate (iN) net of risk adjustment (iR) and the rate used for pension and wages indexation (ip), which makes allowance for productivity growth and inflation. As in the above case with an assumed constant growth parameter, we assume the real interest rate to be constant, at least for the entire lifetime of the birth cohort currently retiring at age 65. In real terms, the FS contribution/benefit ratio then equals the cohort’s years of life spent in retirement, divided by the cohort’s years of life spent at working ages, all life years being discounted at the real interest rate. This may be expressed as follows, with c referring to birth cohort:

COADR(c) = ∫ from R to e^(-ix)l(x; c)dx / ∫ from W to e^(-ix)l(x; c)dx (4)

where COADR stands for the cohort old-age dependency ratio. We shall be comparing the values of OADR and POADR in year t to values of COADR for the cohort retiring (aged 65) in the same year, that is, setting c = t - 65. The model expressions above extend those proposed by Keyfitz, Arthur and McNicoll, and Bourgeois-Pichat in explicitly allowing for the effects of changing survivorship. With declining mortality, the cohort retiring under the FS will have more survivors who are retired than the current retired population, and it may also have had fewer survivors of working age than birth cohorts who are currently working. Both effects, when i is less than g, contribute to an old-age dependency ratio which is larger for the FS than for the PAYG system. Apparently, the central classic result—the equivalence of the two systems when i is less than g—is incorrect when mortality is changing. Estimates of the dependency ratios based on our mortality data and projections are presented in Table 1. For the PAYG system, values of POADR are presented for growth parameters of 0 and 0.59 percent. The latter value of the growth parameter was so chosen that the resulting POADR, 26.8 percent, would match the corresponding estimated OADR, which is also shown in Table 1. The estimated OADR reflects the effects of both the past changes in the number of births and migration on the age composition of the population. Currently, this effect reduces the OADR by around 5.9 percent (32.7-26.8) compared with the model population with zero growth parameter. The FS is represented in Table 1 by model COADR with a real interest rate of 0 and 1.55 percent per annum. Again, this real interest rate was chosen so that the COADR matched the current observed OADR, that is, 26.8 percent. Since the mid-twentieth century, zero interest rate values of COADR have exceeded zero growth parameters of POADR by about half. Both of them were even higher than the actual OADR that takes into account the effect of changes in the number of births and immigration as well as mortality change. Setting the growth parameter at 0.59 percent and the interest rate at 1.55 percent results in the model POADR and the COADR having values roughly similar to those of the actual OADR. The difference (1 percent) suggests that decreasing mortality is a factor affecting the PAYG internal rate of return, a possibility we consider in Section 6. Interestingly, changing mortality appears to be more important than all other factors combined in influencing the current population age composition. The model POADR at g is smaller, by 15.4 percent (48.1-32.7), than the COADR at comparable i because of the effects of changing mortality on cross-sectional and cohort survival probabilities. Other factors, changes in the number of births, and migration, contribute only 5.9 percent (32.7-26.8), as indicated by the difference between the model POADR and the observed OADR. The relative advantage of the PAYG system attributable to changing mortality is currently at its maximum. The difference between POADR and COADR at zero g and i, respectively, has increased from about 6 percent in the 1950s to 15 percent currently; but it is projected to fall back to about 6 percent by 2060. At g is 0.59 percent and i is 1.55 percent, POADR and COADR are currently equal, but both in the past and the future COADR becomes smaller. The reason for this non-linear change of relative advantage to the PAYG system is the acceleration of mortality decline in the past and our assumption of deceleration in the future.
Cohort-based shifting mortality model, the validity of which has been supported by its application to adult mortality data for developed countries (Ediev 2011a, 2011b, 2012):
\( l(x; c) = l(x - kc; 0) \)
where k is the shift per year in the cohort distributions of ages at death. Essentially, k may be interpreted as the cohort-to-cohort rate of change in life expectancy at birth (around 0.38 years per cohort for cohorts currently in their 60s). Applying this model, the cohort-to-cohort rate of change of the FS retirement age \(a(c)\) that yields a constant COADR equals
\[
\frac{d}{dc}a(c) = \left[ \frac{1}{\lambda^{-1}_{R}(c)} \left( \frac{1}{COADR(c)} -1 \right) + 1 \right] \frac{dCLE(c)}{dc}
\]
where \(CLE(c)\) is the cohort life expectancy at birth (\(\frac{dCLE(c)}{dc}=k\)); \(a\) is the age at entering the workforce; and \(\lambda_R(c)\) is the probability of surviving from age \(a\) up to retirement age for cohort \(c\).

At the levels of mortality for cohorts currently in their 60s, and at a 1.55 percent real interest rate, the value of the expression in parentheses in the equation is around 0.5; it is 0.6 at zero real interest rate. Hence, the cohort-to-cohort change of the FS retirement age should be about half the change of the cohort life expectancy in order to secure a constant cohort old-age dependency ratio.

A more practical way of expressing the rate of change of the FS retirement age as a function of the calendar year, \(a_P(t) = a(t - a_P(t))\), is obtained from a transformation of the equation:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}a_P(t) = \frac{d}{dc}a(t - a_P(t))\left(1 + \frac{d}{dc}a(t - a_P(t)) \right)
\]

For the cohorts currently in their 60s, the rate of change of the retirement age is about 0.17 years per year at a 1.55 percent real interest rate, and 0.19 years per year at a zero interest rate.

For the PAYG system, the change rate of the retirement age \(A(t)\) consistent with a constant POADR with shifting cohort mortality is a function of the rate of change of \(CAL (2)\):
\[
\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = \left[ \frac{1}{P(a; t)} \left( \frac{1}{POADR(t)} - 1 \right) + 1 \right] \frac{dCAL(t)}{dt}
\]
where \(\frac{dCAL(t)}{dt}= \frac{k}{1+k}\). In low-mortality countries, the value of the expression in parentheses is currently around 0.7. This results in an annual increase in the PAYG age at retirement of around 0.2 years.
With an ageing population, in which the OADR is increasing with time, the DB IRR will tend to be larger than the DC IRR. No real pension system is purely DB or DC, however. An increasing OADR is likely to create pressure to increase contributions, reduce real benefits, and check further increases in the dependency ratio by increasing the age at retirement as well as to allow more entrants into the system. Such changes would shift the actual PAYG IRR to a value in between the two estimates given above. We define an intermediate, more computationally convenient, and perhaps realistic alternative, ‘the defined-dependency (DD)’ PAYG IRR iDD to supplement the DB and DC estimates of the PAYG IRR. We define it as the real interest rate of the FS that yields, for the currently retiring cohort, a value of COADR equal to that of the current OADR. This definition reflects only the current state of the PAYG system and not the past or future OADR, as do the DB and DC IRRs. It may be interpreted as either of the two conventional PAYG IRRs calculated for a scenario in which the retirement age A(t) is adjusted each period so that the OADR is constant at its current value.

In the classical case of a stable population, with no mortality change, the PAYG IRR, also known as ‘the biological interest rate’, equals the stable population growth rate. In our model, the biological interest rate corresponds to the growth rate parameter, g. In practice, the size of the working population is affected both by changing numbers of births and migration. To isolate these effects on population change from that of mortality change, we define ‘the traditional PAYG IRR’ as the difference between the estimate of the IRR derived from the observed population and the corresponding estimate derived from the model population with g = 0 (the latter estimate reflecting the effect of mortality change only).

Estimates for the three alternative PAYG IRRs are presented in the following table:
- Defined dependency (DD), defined benefit (DB), and defined contribution (DC) pay-as-you-go internal rates of return, per cent per annum, based on the model actual population age composition for the year 1900-2060.

Increasing longevity and pension systems play a crucial role in determining the rates. With zero growth parameter, the current DB IRR is approximately 1.86 per cent, the DC IRR around 0.57 per cent, and the DD IRR is about 1.02 per cent. These are the effects of mortality change alone. The combined effect of all forms of demographic change may be seen from the PAYG IRR estimated from the observed values of OADR whenever the available data cover a period long enough to allow the application of relevant equations. Currently, the empirical DD PAYG IRR is around 1.55 per cent (estimates for individual countries vary).

Our main mortality scenario is more optimistic than that applied in any country's official projections. Results for a less optimistic alternative scenario are less pronounced: the contribution of decreasing mortality to DD PAYG IRR falls from 1.0 to 0.7 per cent, and both DB and DC IRRs are also smaller in the main scenario by around 0.3 per cent. Similarly, the ages at retirement necessary to keep the dependency ratios constant are younger under the less optimistic mortality scenario.

Given the overall similarity in mortality levels and prospects for life expectancy in low-mortality developed countries, our results are applicable to the population of any developed country. However, populations differ more substantially in their age composition, affecting the OADR and, consequently, the corresponding PAYG IRR.
In the main scenario by around 0.3 per cent, about 50 years from now, under the traditional mortality projection assumption, dependency ratios in both pension systems will be about 8 per cent smaller than those under the main scenario. Similarly, the ages at retirement necessary to keep the dependency ratios constant at the level of the base year OADR are 2-3 years younger under the less optimistic mortality scenario. In 2060, the DD PAYG IRR is similar in both the main and less optimistic alternative mortality scenarios (0.22 per cent) because both scenarios assume the increase in longevity declines to zero. However, in a truly optimistic scenario with ever-increasing life expectancy, not shown here, we estimate DD PAYG IRR to be more stable and remain at the rather high level of 0.8 per cent by 2060.

Country-specific results
Given the overall similarity in mortality levels and prospects for life expectancy in low-mortality developed countries, the results presented above for the effects of the change in mortality are applicable to the population of any developed country. Populations differ more substantially, however, in their age composition. Results above based on observed values of OADR should therefore be supplemented with those for individual countries (Table 5).

Only in 9 countries, out of the 24 analyzed, does the traditional PAYG IRR exceed the DD PAYG IRR caused by the mortality decline. In those countries, where the effect of mortality decline is supplemented by higher fertility and immigration, the overall DD PAYG IRR is rather high, and likely to reach, or even exceed, the real interest rate. In Germany and Japan, on the other hand, low fertility and immigration have led to negative traditional IRRs. Yet, even in these two rapidly ageing populations, the DD PAYG IRR is positive, owing to the effect of decreasing mortality.

Discussion
When the growth parameter and real interest rate are equal, our findings show that the PAYG system has a considerable advantage, owing to the effect of decreasing mortality. The advantage may seem puzzling, because the PAYG system is renowned for benefits payable to the first group of those retiring, who would not be covered at all by a funded system. However, with increasing longevity, workers expect to live longer when they retire than current retirees, and consequently be in a better position to fund others’ current pensions, rather than their own future ones. An insight into this apparent paradox may be gained by considering a scheme with no real interest rate where participants suddenly become immortal. In such a case, the FS would become insolvent for cohorts of immortals at any finite age at retirement, while the PAYG system would still be functional (although with an ever-increasing age at retirement to keep up with the increasing elderly population).

The PAYG system’s balance is further improved by the net effects of immigration and changing numbers of births, which have so far resulted in a younger population age composition than mortality alone would imply. Their combined effect, however, has been smaller than that of declining mortality ever since the 1950s. Currently, two-thirds of the DD PAYG IRR (1.0 per cent, in real terms, out of 1.55 per cent) may be ascribed to the relative advantage of the PAYG system of increasing longevity. Even in our less optimistic and traditional mortality scenarios, the effect of mortality change currently contributes more than half of the DD PAYG scheme (0.74 out of 1.29 per cent). The effect of decreasing mortality is therefore important; most of the existing models comparing pension systems have ignored this effect and focused on the less important growth parameter.

Modifying a conventional PAYG scheme for increasing survivorship may be a more efficient and cost-effective measure than converting the scheme into a partially funded one. Increasing life expectancy, by making IRR exceed the real interest rate for more cohorts of voters, may also contribute to the continuing political acceptability of the PAYG system.
The PAYG system's advantage from mortality change is currently estimated to be at its historical maximum. We project this advantage to level off in the long run, but even if mortality eventually stops declining, as in our scenarios, the POADR will only converge to the COADR, and never exceed it. The PAYG IRR, even at g = 0, will monotonically converge to zero without ever becoming negative. In this respect, the differential effect of decreasing mortality on pension systems must not be regarded as a sort of 'pyramid scheme', creating an advantage for contemporary participants in the PAYG system by disadvantaging subsequent generations who are participants in the same system. Also, note that were we to assume a really optimistic scenario with ever-increasing longevity at the current pace of improvement, the PAYG advantage would persist, and the PAYG IRR would remain stable at its currently high level.

Although our study was concerned with countries with currently low levels of mortality, effects similar to, or even larger than, those reported here may also be expected in higher mortality countries. Through the process of catching up with the low-mortality countries, those with high mortality may experience a faster decline in mortality, which may be associated with larger differences in the effects between the funded and PAYG pension systems.

Our findings do not suggest that PAYG is necessarily to be preferred over the FS. That conclusion could be drawn only from a much more complex study that took into account economic, behavioral, and political factors. However, our findings do show that one of the key factors relevant to the design of pension schemes has been largely neglected in previous analyses.
Assuming shift model (5) \(\ell(x; c) = \ell(x - kc; 0)\):
\[
\frac{dJ_R(c)}{dc} = \frac{d}{dc} \left(\int_x a(c) e^{-ix\ell(x; c)}dx \right) = \frac{d}{dc} \left(\int_x a(c) e^{-ix\ell(x - kc; 0)}dx \right)
\]
\[
= -a'(c)e^{-ia(c)\ell(a(c); c)} - k\int_x a(c) e^{-ix\ell'_x(x; c)}dx
\]
\[
= -a'(c)e^{-ia(c)\ell(a(c); c)} - ke^{-ix\ell(x; c)}x_{a(c)}-ik\int_x a(c) e^{-ix\ell(x; c)}dx
\]
\[
= (k - a'(c))e^{-ia(c)\ell(a(c); c)} - ikJ_R(c)
\]
Similarly,
\[
\frac{dJ_W(c)}{dc} = -(k - a'(c))e^{-ia(c)\ell(a(c); c)} + ke^{-ial(a; c)} - ikJ_W(c)
\]
Substituting into (A1):
\[
(k - a'(c))e^{-ia(c)\ell(a(c); c)} \left(\frac{1}{J_R(c)} + \frac{1}{J_W(c)} \right) - k\frac{1}{J_W(c)} e^{-ial(a; c)} = 0
\]
Hence,
\[
a'(c) = k\left(1 - \frac{\ell(a; c)}{\ell(a; c)}\right)[\text{COADR}(c)]^{-1} + 1 e^{\left[ia(c)-a\right]}
\]
which leads to equation (6).

A.2. Derivation of equi-dependency PAYG retirement ages
Assuming a constant \(POADR(t) = \int_x A(t) e^{-gxl(x; t - x)}dx = \int A(t)_{a} e^{-gxl(x; t - x)}dx = \text{IR}/\text{IW}\):
\[
\frac{dPOADR(t)}{POADR(t)dt} = \frac{dIR(t)}{IR(t)dt} - \frac{dIW(t)}{IW(t)dt} = 0
\]

By similar techniques:
\[
\frac{dIW(t)}{dt} = - \left(k \frac{1 + k}{1 + k} - A'(t)\right)e^{-gA(t)\ell(A(t); t - A(t))} + k \frac{1 + k}{1 + k} e^{-gal(a; t - a)} - gk \frac{1 + k}{1 + k} IW(t)
\]
Substituting into (A6):
\[
k \frac{1 + k}{1 + k} - A'(t) e^{-gA(t)\ell(A(t); t - A(t))} \left(\frac{1}{IR(t)} + \frac{1}{IW(t)}\right) - k \frac{1}{IW(t)} e^{-gal(a; t - a)} = 0
\]
Hence,
\[
A'(t) = k \frac{1 + k}{1 + k} (1 - \frac{\ell(a; t - a)}{\ell(A(t); t - A(t))})[\text{POADR}(t)]^{-1} + 1 e^{g(A(t)-a)} = k \frac{1 + k}{1 + k} (1 - \frac{P(a; t)}{P(A(t))})[\text{POADR}(t)]^{-1} + 1
\]
which leads to equation (8) given the change rate of the cross-sectional average length of life after entering the working age:
\[
\frac{dCAL(t)}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left(\int_0 \ell(x; t - x)dx \right) = \frac{d}{dt} \left(\int_0 \ell(x - k(t - x); 0)dx \right) = - k \frac{1 + k}{1 + k} \int_0 \left(\frac{d}{dx} \ell(x; t - x)\right)dx = k \frac{1 + k}{1 + k}
\]
Similarly, JW = ∫(A + (a-A)) e^(-gx) e^(-(i-g)x l(x - k(x - A); t - x)) dx = IW + (a - A)e^(-gA) l(A; t - A) - (i - g)IWXW - CAL0 * l(a; t - a)e^(-ga)(A - a) + CAL0 * IW.

Hence, substituting into:
COADR(t - A) = IR - (a - A)e^(-gA) l(A;t - A) - (i - g)IRXR + CAL0 * IR IW + (a - A)e^(-gA) l(A;t - A) - (i - g)IWXW - CAL0 * l(a;t - a)(A - a)e^(-ga) + CAL0 * IW - IR IW 1 - (a - A)e^(-gA) l(A;t - A) IR - (i - g)XR + CAL0 1 - (a - A)e^(-gA) l(A;t - A) IW + (i - g)XW + CAL0 * l(a;t - a)e^(-ga)(A - a) IW - CAL0 = POADR(t) = 1 - (i - g)(XR - XW) + CAL0 * l(a;t - a)e^(-ga)(A - a) IW - (a - A)e^(-gA) l(A;t - A) 1 IR + 1 IW .

The equality COADR(t - A) = POADR(t) implies:
(i - g)(XR - XW) - CAL0 * l(a; t - a) e^(-ga)(A - a) IW - (a - A)e^(-gA) l(A; t - A) 1 IR + 1 IW = CAL0 - (A - a) P(a) PW - (a - A) P(A) PW 1 POADR + 1.

Hence, the equivalent FS retirement age is given as a = A - (i - g)(XR - XW) PW P(A) (POADR - 1 + 1) + CAL0 - (A - a) P(a) P(A) (POADR - 1 + 1).

The PAYG IRR interest rate which ensures that the FS dependency ratio equals the POADR finally, we estimate the DD PAYG IRR as an FS interest rate which results in an identical dependency ratio in both systems at a = A. Substituting this into:
(i - g)(XR - XW) - CAL0 - (A - a) P(a) PW that is i = g + CAL0 - (A - a)P(a) (XR - XW)PW.

With a small growth parameter and low mortality at working ages, PW = (A - a)P(a) and i = g + CAL0 XR - XW.
